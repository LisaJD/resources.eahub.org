## Day 1 (Sunday 8th)

### Opening session

#### Harri

*   Thanks everybody for coming!
*   Goals of the retreat:
    *   **Strategy**
    *   **Tactics **- what do EA groups do that is valuable concretely
    *   **Coordination **- EA groups are similar and there are many ways that we can work together
    *   **Planning **- how we can put what we've learned into action
*   Tips to get the most out of the retreat
    *   First 2 days will more content (presentations, etc.), then will get more relaxed and flexible.
        *   Incorporate the information presented into our own understanding of EA communities and EA groups
    *   Conversations - think about how people can help you / how you can help them

#### Katie (& Huw)



*   Logistics
    *   Agenda in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CUcIi79eUu0W2gj4j1s4FxKdGtqXV4ug)
    *   [Slack](http://eacommunityretreat.slack.com) - links, notes documents, changes to the agenda, requests (which may or may not be fulfilled)
    *   Volunteer leads
        *   Make sure everyone knows when their shift is and what there is to do
    *   **Check Slack or the boards if you have questions**
    *   Will try to be very punctual and start all sessions perfectly on time
    *   Shoes off inside
    *   Quiet rooms - try not to use them for chats (move to main house)
    *   Plan showers throughout the day (not everyone together - might break water system)
    *   Tell Katie / Huw if stuff breaks - "honesty book"
    *   Don't press the panic button or the police WILL come
*   Social stuff
    *   Impostor syndrome is awful and creates a bad atmosphere
        *   Don't need to act really brainy: **beginner's mind**, being wrong is good
        *   You can ask questions, get a chance to learn things - everyone learns from each other
        *   #Nodumbquestions channel on Slack
    *   Take care of yourself and others! 
        *   Pretty intense week, make sure you get enough sleep (snug room if you need it), do what you need to feel better if you're sick, let others rest, be respectful in conversations, don't make others feel bad
        *   See Katie or Julia if you have any problem or want to chat about something
        *   Code of Conduct - respect it!
        *   "Celebrating EA Guiding Principles" - write people's names on the board when they respect EA Guiding Principles
*   **Question to the group: **things that would make this a good retreat?
    *   Informal time to chat / laugh / games with other EAs
    *   Concrete to do's at the end and a clear vision of where to go next
    *   Coordination - get a better sense of where people are and what risks they see for community building


### Speed Intros



*   1 min presentations of each attendee and 1 min of questions 
*   See [Names & Faces](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZWd36CP4VURKbJ97jTD7qbGKDPDEePwfp8HdSnbRJo/edit#slide=id.p) slides


## Day 2 - Strategy (Monday 9th)


### Session 1 - CEA Strategy (Larissa)



*   Larissa is responsible for much of the day to day management of CEA
*   Purpose of this talk:
    *   Context for why local groups are important, and topics of the rest of retreat
    *   Local groups** **are on the ground, so that they have first hand **experience of what works**, and can / should provide **feedback **based on this
*   Outline
    *   Who (1 - Larissa ; 2 - CEA)
    *   Why CEA does the work it does
    *   How EA gets us to what we care about
    *   What CEA is prioritising
*   Questions to the group:
    *   "Who or what is CEA?"
    *   "Why does CEA do the work it does?" 
    *   "What does CEA do day to day and why?" 
*   **Who**: Info about Larissa
    *   Became involved in CEA when she ran a local group in Brighton, didn't know much about EA at the time but was very organised and had regular meetups. Optimised for the number of people who were there, rather than what people talked about and took away
    *   Social media / community volunteer for GWWC
    *   Full time CEA 2016
        *   Marketing, communications, head of community (events, local groups), now COO
        *   You have the opportunity to do a lot of things at CEA and expand your area of expertise
    *   Studied politics (Sussex), learned about moral weight of other species (veggie then vegan), and through reading Peter Singer started to increase the number of EA-related changes in her life: first donations & GWWC pledge, then EA & time (volunteering for the EA community), then far future,... The more she learned, the more she realised how little she knows - kind of the idea of EA
*   **Why**: CEA strategy 
    *   We all care deeply about the wellbeing of others regardless of things like species / when or where born ("maximise wellbeing")
    *   **CEA's vision: an optimal world** (intentionally very ambitious and vague, huge space of things we don't know and haven't figured out yet)
*   _Brainstorming exercise:_
    *   _What is one problem we need to solve for the world to be as good as possible?_
        *   _Death / suffering associated with death_
        *   _Global mental health_
        *   _Coordination of people in the world_
        *   _Measuring subjective experiences of wellbeing_
        *   _Understanding the question better_
    *   _How might we solve that?_
        *   _Medicine? Painkillers?_
        *   _Breakthroughs in advanced consciousness research_
    *   _Why is it not solved already?_
        *   _Transportation, coordination, research..._
        *   _Perverse incentives structure_
*   **Why**: we care deeply, there's a lot we don't know
    *   How can we go about learning more, what can we learn?
*   **How**: need to act, this will have to include (for most of the world's needs):
    *   **People * **/ talent
        *   Maybe in the future --> technology, but until that exists we need more people doing useful work
    *   Ideas framework (rigour, evidence, reason, keeping an open mind)
        *   Global Priorities Institute (GPI)
        *   Future of Humanity Institute (FHI)
    *   Resources (e.g. Money)
        *   OpenPhil
        *   Pledges / donors
        *   Less of a bottleneck right now but still important
    *   **Coordination** (CEA current focus and comparative advantage)
        *   Multiplier



*   How EA gets us to what we care about
    *   EA is
        *   An idea: that we care a lot about the world, that we need reason & evidence, that we can change our minds and adapt
        *   A community
*   People
    *   You can't achieve anything without people
    *   How to prioritise? Incredibly difficult, because we're talking about prioritising people, but that's also what EA / life is about - need to prioritise our time and money to find the right people (people who have more money? Or a better network?) At least think carefully about this
        *   **Resources **(money, network / influence, ability to do paid work / make money / do useful work)
        *   **Dedication **(% time, excitement)
        *   **Realisation **(how efficiently resources used, thinking carefully about the things they are trying to achieve)
    *   Important challenges / trade-offs:
        *   **Prioritisation --> exclusion**
        *   **Inclusion --> coordination**
*   Coordination
    *   Community model - CEA believes that **a tightly knit group achieves much more than individuals**
        *   Think about impact of starting a project on the existing ones, what others are doing...
        *   "Doing Good Together"
    *   **Norms **(what kind of culture you set up in your group, intentional or not...?) - see EA values
        *   Epistemics (honesty, humility, curiosity, rigour, openness)
        *   Non-epistemic norms (friendliness, modesty, helpfulness)
    *   **In person interaction** is important (importance of local groups)
        *   High bandwidth
        *   Easier to resolve disagreement
        *   Nuance (you can lose much of that nuance with some methods of communications)
    *   How do we grow safely?
        *   How do we grow but still coordinate?
        *   How do you add people to the community so that they actually bring value?
    *   **Risks**:
        *   Insufficient diversity / hostile environment
        *   Reputation
        *   Dilution of ideas
        *   Poor (online) discussion - less people who understand the concepts
        *   Miss new opportunities - e.g. everything becomes about LT future and we might be foregoing other causes
*   **Summary of how and what**
    *   **Aiming for the best possible world --> need more people, better ideas, coordination, resources**
*   CEA Structure
    *   Focus on: **people already in the community, updating info, learning about coordination **--> grow
    *   Teams at CEA:
        *   **Individual Outreach** - EA Grants, Retreats, Local Groups, EAG?
        *   **Research & Content** - Online content, EAG content, Sharing ideas, Community health (thinking about norms in the community, social work, mitigating negative sides)
        *   **Operations **(HR, Finance, Legal, Offices)
        *   **Tech **(EA Funds, Web, Support)
*   Local groups are essential because we need:
    *   More people
    *   Coordinate across the world
    *   Spread ideas with nuance (think about how spreading ideas actually works)
    *   To help people up skill
*   Feedback
    *   Does the CEA communicate well about what it's about?
    *   Highest priority of CEA - help? What to deprioritise?
*   **Q&A**
    *   Q: Coordination - feels like the CEA's stance has shifted (before "Oxford ivory tower", now more open to different ideas / people)
        *   A: Unsure whether this is true. There are opportunities to share insights: EAGs, 1 on 1s, retreats… It's always possible to ask CEA how much they've thought about what they're saying, and to take it with a pinch of salt
    *   Q: GWWC seems to be mostly part of the tech team now (online, trying to link My Giving to EA Funds), is there no more focus on the donations aspect?
        *   A: Donations are still very important, but GWWC is more linked to the community (with Julia as its president). There was a big restructure at CEA (complicated history and has changed a lot, before incubator for projects now more consolidation)
    *   Q: Are we targeting particular demographics / skillsets?
        *   A: Yes, **operations **(doesn't seem to be as valued in EA, seems quite hard to hire experienced operations people). Many orgs are saying this - cf. [80K post](https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/). Also trying to make sure that all groups feel represented - no demographic group has the monopoly on finding the best ways of making the world better
    *   Q: 80K video - seems less about nuance / more about mass outreach. 
        *   A: Unsure, hasn't seen the video. Knows that 80K want to make this part of an online course, that might explain the style of the video.

 


### Session 2 - Empowering People (Harri)



*   Ultimate goal: do the most good
*   **Method: empower others **(that's also why we're doing this community building retreat)
*   2 perspectives which inform each other, the best is to take them in combination
    *   Individual
    *   Community
*   Caveats
    *   Tension within the the aims of EA community building (**inclusion / exclusion**, **egalitarianism vs elitism**)
        *   Important to focus on how the world actually works and how we can work with that
        *   How can we tackle problems that arise due to these tensions? 
*   _Brainstorming exercise: What are the determinants of how much impact an individual can have on the world?_
    *   _Dedication, resources, resource efficiency + environment (not emphasised enough - e.g. management, etc. are really important)_
    *   _People being able to do all of these things, not just on one dimension_
*   **3 Factor Model **(technical terms which in some way map onto the common sense definition) - nice feature is that, although not fine-grained enough to be quantifiable, should be possible to multiply through to get "how much value can one be able to contribute".
    *   **Resources **- scale of resources that someone could devote to any particular activities (time - could be dependent on skills, can think of it as human capital ; money). E.g. How much income?
    *   **Dedication **- proportion of someone's overall resources that they devote to doing good. E.g. How much income to charity?
    *   **Realisation **- efficiency of the resources devoted to doing good and how much impact they actually have. E.g. How much to effective charities?
*   _Brainstorming exercise: If these are good things, how can one increase them? How can we empower people?_
    *   _Resources: tips to increase time / money / skills / network_
    *   _Dedication: more motivation (community of people, friends, underlying moral framework, arguments, emotional arguments), information / knowledge / space to figure things out_
    *   _Realisation: 1) increasing knowledge the community has, 2) increasing knowledge that goes from community to individual_
*   Question: how quantifiable are these different aspects?
    *   Kit - used predecessor of the model to estimate value of finance group, and although v imprecise, helps to build a Fermi estimate
    *   Harri - agnostic as to how this is applicable to individuals
*   Increasing different aspects:
    *   Resources: increase ability of people to do things in general (CFAR, 80K,...)
        *   Hard, maybe not EA community's comparative advantage - there is a general incentive for people everywhere to increase their resources, including private companies: it might be better to steal the best techniques which exist in the world rather than develop our own framework
    *   Dedication: pledge
    *   Realization: content (more general understanding of EA), GiveWell, 80K
    *   Also important: idea of **community **(dedication and realisation)
*   Important to think about what is the **distribution of these 3 factors** and how much they **vary**
    *   In the same way as for charities (**heavy tailed distribution**), there should be a similar phenomenon wrt the impact that people are going to be able to have
    *   Unfortunate, would be nice to live in a world where this were not true and people had access to the same opportunities regardless of where they were born, etc. but if it's a true fact about the world that we should take it into account
    *   Resources: True for **distribution of income**, but also **EA orgs hires** for example (orgs are willing to pay 2 to 7 times more for senior hires than junior hires) - we can expect this to follow a similar heavy tailed distribution
    *   Dedication: Average yearly **percentage of income donated** in the US - 3%, GWWC pledge - 10%, some people - 50%: makes a huge difference
    *   Realisation: Comparing **charities / interventions** but also the value of different **cause areas**. Even if we are somewhat agnostic about how to compare cause areas, it seems that the differences are pretty huge
    *   Difficult to work out the exact distributions
*   _Brainstorming exercise: What are the implications of this?_
    *   _Mistakes:_
        *   _Idea that outreach through talks and mass media is the best way to go - assumes normal distrib, trying to cast a wide net --> should put more focus on word of mouth approach_
        *   _More outreach but with strong filtering mechanisms, warning on overupdating on the tails_
    *   _2 dimensions: individual vs community scales._
        *   _Individual: Identify bottlenecks_
        *   _Community (local vs global) - local groups have a clear comparative advantage to reinforce dedication, whereas realisation can be done more at a global level for example_
*   Implications
    *   More valuable to focus on** increasing some of the factors for people who are already very high on some of these attributes** (e.g. increase 1 factor for people already high on the 2 others)
        *   Although unclear whether harder to increase those attributes when people are already v high (concave growth?)
    *   Implications on target audience / community size are unclear
*   Worries
    *   Egalitarianism vs Elitism: EA has been criticised for being elitist but odd tension because it seems that EAs generally are more egalitarian than most people
    *   Inclusion vs Exclusion: same kind of issue as excluding some causes / interventions - we don't have clear answers
*   **Q&A**
    *   Q: Model doesn't have strong conclusions, but CEA seems to have updated quite a lot?
        *   A: The model itself can lead to v different answers based on different assumptions, but combined with other models / assumptions that CEA does make (will talk about this later), they have converged to some answers
    *   Q: Quick conclusions as to what local groups priorities should be?
        *   A: Yes - **people pipeline**, but will discuss this further later on
*   _Brainstorming exercise (1-2-4)_
    *   _Confusions_
    *   _Disagreements_
    *   _Implications_

 


### Session 3 - Models of EA groups (Harri)

 



*   _Brainstorming exercise ("Community Perspective"): What determines the value of the EA community?_
    *   _How much good done in the world by EAs? How many people convinced to spend more of their resources / spend better on doing good? Information?_
    *   _Collective resources, coordination - not covered by individual framework_
*   Community
    *   The **EA community is an instrumental good.** Working on the **meta level**: **increase the impact other people can have.** 
    *   One way of looking at it is that the value of the community is the summed value of the individuals.
    *   But it leaves out the aspect of how we can coordinate to achieve better outcomes.
        *   Information flows - we need to incentivise good ideas (and disincentivise bad ideas?)
        *   Allocate people in positions where they have a comparative advantage
    *   Messier - CEA has different models about the community, unsure how they relate
*   **Funnel Model** (fuzzy - hard to work it out in terms of engagement but leaving out immersion and vice versa)
    *   Immersion vs Engagement
        *   **Immersion **- how well does someone understand the ideas of EA and act on them
        *   **Engagement **- interaction with EA community
    *   Hidden premise: if we increase engagement we increase immersion? We could have one without the other
    *   **Audience > Supporters > Participants > Contributors > Core  > Leadership** (determines how the EA community works)
    *   Engagement doesn't necessarily mean impact
        *   **No community**: instead of focusing on the EA community, we could imagine just giving out Doing Good Better to everyone 
        *   **Loose community**?
        *   **Tight-knit community**?
*   _Brainstorming exercise: How tightly/loosely coordinated should the EA community be? How important is engagement?_
    *   _It seems very valuable, at least for the "dedication" / continued action taking. Also dynamic (evolution of ideas, you need to keep up to date and discuss newest ideas - just giving out DGB doesn't do that). Also brainstorming seems to bring out things that you don't find yourself_
    *   _Depends on how good we are at disseminating knowledge. Who should be involved? → People who need a community to remain motivated (not everyone thinks that this is important)_
    *   _2 ways in which we could need both_
        *   _Looser, larger, broader community BECAUSE it's good for the core_
        *   _Looser, larger, broader community EVEN IN SPITE OF THE core_
    *   _Direct work seems important, irrelevant of how tight knit the community is_
    *   _Careful not to conflate "people are interacting a lot with us" with "people are doing valuable things" - higher engagement doesn't mean higher impact_
    *   _How we define engagement makes a difference - taboo by "how many back and forths you have had with EA community members"_
*   Defining engagement - Level of interaction with the EA community
    *   Type: **in person / online**
    *   Relevant features: **frequency, depth**
    *   Direction: **unidirectional **(reading EA NL, reading EA Forum...) **/** **bidirectional **(conversations, commenting on EA Forum...)
*   The importance of engagement
    *   3-factor model
        *   Realisation - somewhat more complex.
            *   Requires more than just following GW / 80K recommendations
            *   If we can give people all the info online so that they make decisions that enable them to most effectively allocate their resources towards doing good - engagement is less important
            *   **No easy canonised version of everything available online atm, so that conversations seem important**
        *   Dedication
            *   If you just have to be morally convinced - only need to read _Famine, Affluence & Morality_
            *   But **likely that you also need relationships **- e.g. friends in EA
            *   Varies from person to person, but it seems that for most people engagement is an important part of dedication
    *   Scale
        *   Number of people who can attend an EAG, local group... is limited - harder to scale than distributing books for example, or reading 80K career guide
        *   In person interaction is harder to scale than online interaction
*   _Brainstorming exercise: How much do you agree with the following claim:_
    *   _1) You need people high on the 3 factors; 2) Engagement in the community is useful for this purpose; 3) this engagement, especially. in person, is hard to scale_
*   Harri feels that the type of engagement which is likely to be most helpful is **high-frequency, high-depth, bidirectional interaction, most likely in person**
*   The ideal portfolio of "engagement" activities includes a broad spectrum of different things
    *   **Reversibility **- similar to maintaining option value
        *   Mass outreach of EA is less reversible than keeping the EA community small
    *   **Self-sorting** - people tend to join with other similar people
        *   Founder effect - over-representation of philosophers in the EA community
        *   Lack of demographic diversity
        *   Developing a specific type of community will attract similar types of people, so you need to be careful about the atmosphere of the community you develop
    *   **Filtering / allocation** - difficult to do on the basis of little information
        *   Need to know people well
        *   If it's the case that we are able to gain all relevant information about people / projects through a half page essay, engagement is less importance
*   **CEA's current strategy**
    *   **Fostering a small community through dedication & realisation**
*   _Brainstorming exercise (1 - 2 - 4)_
    *   _Confusions / disagreements / implications_
        *   _Although high impact doesn't imply high engagement, plausible that we should focus on this at the level of local groups if it is a source of impact_
        *   _If we were all to take away 3 main conclusions, what would they be?_
        *   _Self-sorting --> people can select according to different criteria_
        *   _Why should we use the 3FM with overlapping of fuzzy concepts rather than doing what we're currently doing?_
        *   _Are we trying to reinvent the wheel or are there lessons to be learnt from other communities which have worked well?_
        *   _How you increase someone's dedication?_
            *   _Seems extremely hard to do - realising people's potential seems like a way of increasing dedication_
        *   _Is the goal of the retreat defining or implementing CEA's strategy?_
        *   _If 80K is doing less coaching, it would be useful to have more communication between central orgs and local groups, and within local groups_
        *   _Value of professional headhunting, management, etc. for EA orgs._
*   **Key takeaways: **
1.  **We can create high-value people by finding talented people and making them very  dedicated + realised**
1.  **High frequency / fidelity / depth engagement (i.e. interaction with the EA community) is essential to increase dedication and realisation**
1.  **CEA's current strategy is to increase the dedication and realisation of current EA community members**

 

 


### Session 4 - Presentation of local groups

 



*   Outline
    *   1 sentence: your group's goals
    *   Deliverables
        *   Outreach --> engagement
        *   A typical year / month / week
    *   Organisation

 


#### **EA Cambridge (Sebastian)**



*   Aiming to produce people with high understanding and high dedication
*   Deliverables
    *   3 main outreach events
        *   Intro discussion group
        *   Careers workshop
        *   < 1 events
    *   Supplementary outreach events
        *   Advanced discussion groups 1 / week
        *   Career profile pres (young professionals working on EA)
        *   Learning groups (AI Safety seminar, Biorisk seminar)
    *   More informal events
        *   Pub social, socialising
        *   1 on 1s more focused on careers
        *   Career feedback session
*   Organisation
    *   Big committee (30 people) - interested in feedback on how to manage a large team
    *   Mostly student group but also events with post-grads
*   Issue:
    *   People are not socialising as much as they did before, the social community could be better
*   Q&A:
    *   Q: Metrics to track impact?
        *   A: Have been discussing it a lot, not clear yet. Big fans of trying things out - Oxford and Cambridge first then if it works → roll it out
    *   Q: Which deliverable is most impactful? 
        *   A: Unclear, aimed at very different audiences
    *   Q: Why is EA Cambridge working so well? Historical reasons?
        *   A: Very motivated people, and when they make a plan they deliver on it


#### **EA Netherlands (Remmelt)** 



*   Deliverables
    *   Outreach (lectures, career workshops, social media. No more media outreach)
    *   Events (monthly event actively solving problems encountered by different groups in the NL, decentralised session focused on specific issues, EAGx on 29th June, "Values to Actions" retreat)
    *   Support (helped people start a number of projects - AI Safety Camp, research)
*   Organisation
    *   Work at a freelancer hub (good relation - benefits for team members)
    *   Monthly events are community-organised
*   1 thing good at
    *   Theoretically, seeing through the dynamics of networks and community buildings
*   1 thing need help
    *   Too many things going on (finances, metrics...) could get better at delegation, need help prioritising
*   Q&A
    *   Q: How useful would more funding be?
        *   A: Right now they don't have much funding - would remove the financial stress for Remmelt personally if he didn't have to worry about this. Doesn't make sense to grow team too fast before they have a good team
    *   Q: Demographics?
        *   A: Lean towards young people - "Student Nerds", Social Entrepreneurs, High Net Worth individuals (= large philanthropists targeted by Kellie Liket and Robert Boogaard, but they are more focused on global poverty)
    *   Q; Plans to scale? Local groups in the NL?
        *   A: EA NL started off as a monthly meeting of local groups, but it seemed like local group organisers weren't that focused on improving. Remmelt feels that they should build up the core community and focus on the people already involved rather than try to scale too fast. 

 


#### **EA China (Graham)**

 



*   Core team of 7 people with one full time staff (Brian) and 2 more likely to go full time
*   Deliverables
    *   Level 1 - direct work 
        *   Advisory for different cause areas / target audiences
        *   Community building (individual outreach and career workshops)
    *   Level 2 - meta
        *   Expert networking (building databases of relevant people)
        *   Macro strategy (China messaging, Global Priorities in the context of China - foundational research vs default in the West)
    *   Level 3 - organisational
*   Particular challenges of the work in China, how it is different from the West
    *   How to fly things through government, avoid sensitive topics
    *   Many things in EA based on Western way of seeing things - important to adjust to China context. E.g. large philanthropy (OpenPhil...) doesn't resonate at all with Chinese people
    *   Fairly aligned in terms of X risk, animal welfare
        *   US / China relations might be an issue worth considering
        *   Seems possible to get major changes in e.g. animal welfare since the government is more centralised, by dedicating funding to these questions
*   Trying to keep organisational best practices but quite informal
*   Challenge
    *   Mostly expert database

 


#### **EA Czech Republic (Jan)**

 



*   Tried to figure out the comparative advantage of EA in Czech Republic
    *   Different meaning of 10% of income in Prague than in Oxford
    *   Good students of quantitative sciences, computer science, etc.
    *   They are not doing research themselves, but steering existing academia to questions which seem relevant to them
*   Deliverables
    *   [Website](http://effectivethesis.com) on effective final theses (bottleneck from EA orgs, who are unable to produce suggestions of relevant thesis topics)
    *   CFAR workshop in Europe
    *   Weekend retreat
    *   EAGx Prague
    *   Trying to quantitatively answer the question of "working locally vs moving to EA hubs" (difficult to get a good answer, they attempt to model a typical person and use guesstimates for the relevant considerations, distribution of parameters and outcomes. Still early stages)
    *   Working on X risk institution in Prague (directing funding - X risk is neither funding nor time constrained but structurally constrained, with orgs unable to absorb all the people who would want to work for them. They want to give people studying machine learning at PhD level, etc. the opportunity to apply this to AI Safety. They are in touch with FHI about this. 50% AI, 50% other x-risks) 
*   Organisational structure
    *   Association with a board composed of people heading projects (7 members)
    *   Local groups

 


#### ** EA Oxford (James) ** 



*   Will only focus on the things they do differently / things people may disagree with
*   They are maximally efficient at producing students with ABZ plans. This is their goal and their metric, and James believes you can get away with measuring only this
*   They outsource "learning about EA" more than other groups
    *   Give people resources, remove frictions (handing books, printing copies of material available online)
    *   Don't think they are able to convey ideas better than other EA orgs
*   Thinks you should focus on yourself before focusing on other people
    *   Most of the value comes from the leaders and what they do with their career
    *   Having a succession in place is enough
*   Organisational structure 
    *   Team of 4 people (unelected and all on the same page)
*   Things they do
    *   1 on 1 meetings - you should know everyone in your community
    *   Give out books frequently
    *   EA Concepts & 80K workshop
        *   Trying to get people to do ABZ plans
*   Groups shouldn't
    *   Do speaker events - hard to get good speakers and waste of time
    *   Fundraise - ask CEA for money
    *   Do direct work projects - work on yourselves
*   Q&A: 
    *   Less convinced about his opinions than it comes across
    *   Concerns about Oxford group - need to prevent social lock in & homogeneous culture - deliberately establish contact with people who come to events from marginalised groups
    *   Could do more but doing ok on that field
    *   Ox / Cam test on what works best
    *   You maybe need a certain type of people to be able to focus on themselves? Important to have good social contact within the community

 


#### **EA Sweden (Markus)**

 



*   EA Sweden is a mixture of different kinds of groups - national group + EA Stockholm + 3 student groups in Stockholm (to whom Markus provides a little bit of coaching)
*   Organisation: full time staff + committee + volunteers
*   Deliverables
    *   Events - 1 social / month, a few reading groups, 1 workshop, 2 external lectures, 1 intro to EA every other month, careers club, "Jefferson dinners" (getting high resource people to spend time on EA)
    *   Projects - EAGx, retreat, representation for future generations (take into account interests of future generations better in Swedish politics)
*   Did fairly well on the diversity (80% female board)
    *   Always put emphasis on that in the group
    *   Did a workshop to raise awareness
    *   Talk about these issues, change the way they do events
*   Wants to learn more about being a leader
*   Sweden-specific
    *   Getting people to donate money is not very useful in Sweden - focus on other things
    *   Representation for Future Generations - many AI researchers and people interested in X risk
    *   Before mostly in Swedish, now mostly in English (most of the outreach and events, depending on the audience)
*   3 student groups set up in Stockholm
    *   Coordinate among themselves, Markus meets them for coaching once every 2 months
*   Things EA Sweden needs help with
    *   Impact measurement, admin stuff - doesn't believe that they should have to think too much about this (duplicate with what already exists)
    *   Money to grow as an org - maybe 1 FTE, 1 intern, pocket change for the org

 


#### **EA Norway (Eirin)**



*   Goal - finding their comparative advantage, figuring out whether they should focus on direct work or community building
    *   Current view: short distance to policy makers, business / NGO leaders - might be worth trying to influence
    *   "It's only Norway" - worth trying stuff out and failing for information value
*   Deliverables
    *   Counterfactual donations (Effect Foundation - at the moment only focused on GiveWell charities, maybe in the future will extend to other cause areas)
    *   Summer internship program - 2 / 3 people
    *   1 on 1 support
    *   Trying out projects
    *   Web
*   Organisational structure
    *   Elected board, 4 members with 3 women
    *   2 full time employees starting this fall
    *   Part time tech employee (and planning more in the future)
    *   Volunteers
*   Applied to CEA Community Building Grant + Norwegian donors
    *   High taxes but also high wages and people willing to donate - focus on fundraising
*   Q&A
    *   Q: Challenges in Norway? A: Haven't focused much on structure / strategic planning until now
    *   Q: Focus on high impact career choices? A: They could act as a pipeline out of Norway to other countries, they are thinking about it (atm mostly in local groups, including in high schools)
    *   Q: Language? A: Most things are in Norwegian, but Oslo uni - in English
    *   Q: Difference with other groups? Norway is much more egalitarian - does it impact their strategy? A: Focused on their org rather than individuals, but not completely consensus-based, they are willing and able to change the course of what they are doing when needed 
    *   Q: Most frequently endorsed cause areas in their group? A: A year ago - global poverty, now more x risks

 


#### **EA Geneva (Konrad)**



*   Since June 2017 Max and Konrad are working FT
*   They are a city / regional group, with student groups splitting off that they will start coaching
*   They are focusing on the community to allow people to engage with contents, including rationality
*   Deliverables
    *   Intro to EA seminar (want to build a profound one on the technical side of EA) - good way to make EA more accessible / friendly. If they had less of those they would lose people (turnover, people move out of Geneva a lot)
    *   Mentoring for key people in the community
    *   Setting up a professional group of 35+ (need to think about things differently than with younger people)
    *   Giving talks across Switzerland & Germany
    *   In Geneva - advanced policy things (60 pages of literature review for Geneva Macro Labs)
    *   Philanthropy (low taxes and high pay - lots of money, makes sense to focus on philanthropy. Much of the money has to stay in Geneva - they are thinking about how to work with this. Everything works through personal contact - need to meet the right people)
*   Community house - cool place to hang out, but sometimes also location for seminars
*   Organisation
    *   Over 30 people trying to contribute - organising as sociocracy / holacracy
    *   Board of directors > executives > student groups / community groups
*   Impact tracking
    *   180 [IASPC](https://80000hours.org/2016/12/metrics-report-2016/#impact-adjustment-of-plan-changes) (Impact-Adjusted Significant Plan Changes) measured from summer to december; but judgement calls are hard. More 10s than .1s (but maybe .1s not taking survey - self selection)
    *   Also trying to measure how they change people's perspectives on things
*   Documentation is hard

 


#### **EA London (Holly)**



*   Focusing on existing community / subcommunities
    *   Helping people with high impact careers (also David - 1 to 1 coaching, Holly is learning to get good at that)
*   Subgroups
    *   Finance groups - social events for professionals
    *   HIPE - mainly career coaching for civil servants who want to have more impact
    *   2 student groups (UCL, LSE)
    *   Animal group
    *   AI strategy and policy
    *   APPG - future generations
*   They also support orgs in London
    *   Founder's Pledge
    *   DeepMind
    *   Animal groups
*   Also events such as
    *   Retreats & weekends
    *   Work on diversity, emotional support, monthly social (although focusing more on existing community)
*   Q&A
    *   Q: Metrics? A: They plan to focus on stories of impact, repeat attendance and IASPC
    *   Q; What do subgroups look like? A: Teams or individuals leading them, EA London support them when they can. They give advice, host meetups, funnel people towards them for coaching, organise "Cause Battles"
    *   Q: Where does most of the value come from? A: Missing a lot of the career changes that happen (not reported). 1 to 1 career coaching seems like a good bet. It's hard to judge between subgroups
    *   Q: What kind of emotional support? A: Peer support group. Would like to talk to mental health nurse for instance. Holly tried to delegate but it didn't work  


#### **EA France (Laura)**

 



*   Trying to find where they can have the more value (community building vs direct work)
*   Deliverables: 
    *   Bimonthly meetups, workshops, retreats, book sharing, etc.
    *   Experimenting with different kinds of projects (applied research - e.g. looking at whether they can leverage the high tax deductibility in France, translating GiveWell / OpenPhil / ACE criteria to make it clear and accessible to French donors, philanthropic advice - e.g. BNP Paribas, book translation, policy, ).
*   Organisation: 
    *   Around 15 volunteers organized in teams (Community, Finance & Regulation, Research, Communications, Donors & Institutions) 

 


## Day 3 - Tactics (Tuesday 10th)


### Session 1 - How Groups Provide Value (Harri)



*   Overview - fuzzier than yesterday
    *   **Comparative advantage of EA groups** in general - specific comparative advantage relating to your group (examples)
    *   **Types of groups** - student, city / local, national (Harri has more experience with student groups)
    *   **Confidence **- what framework to use to work out if your group will have a comparative advantage in a specific area
*   Note on comparative advantage - 2 relevant factors (**Value** & **Fit**)
    *   If 2 activities have the same value, then do what you're best at. If one activity is hugely more valuable than another, do that regardless of your comparative advantage
*   Groups all have a comparative advantage for** EA immersion**
    *   It is both a **high value** activity AND groups have some amount of **comparative advantage** (especially student groups)
    *   **Immersion = realisation x dedication** (understanding + acting upon EA principles)
    *   Is engagement important for immersion?
*   **Funnel model** - check out [Charlie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItqdEuhXL6arMfUU5aISnHlP1PRjXx4MC95htMo15z4/edit)'s and [Tobias](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4JYWuttp6CZauzH9lkry-srEIZtN2ao2T5x2bP6oXo/edit)' more detailed models 
    *   **Outreach **(finding people and introducing them to EA) > **Development **(understand the ideas and be motivated by them) > **Action**
    *   Outcomes: people working in high impact areas
*   Immersion seems to be pretty straightforward, what about other activities?
    *   **Raising awareness** - large scale marketing, content distribution, etc. - Harri doesn't think that it's one of the best things for EA groups to do
        *   Not the right time - many changes in the community and ideas, so in the next 6 months / 1 year we would be promoting an outdated version of EA if we pushed that today, it's better to wait
        *   Comparative advantage - other people / orgs can devote much more time to things like content creation
        *   Coordination - this has an effect on the overall EA community and what it becomes, so that it makes sense to be more cautious about it 
    *   **Fundraising **- also probably not the best thing
        *   Talent vs funding constraint
        *   Equivalent in terms of direct work - cf [80K survey](https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/) about how much EA orgs would be willing to pay for their latest junior / senior hires: for EA groups, it is easier to create 1 EA org employee than raise the equivalent in donations
    *   Harri doesn't think that these are the best ultimate aim for EA groups. However, such types of direct work could be seen as instrumental ways of increasing immersion. 
*   _Brainstorming exercise: What other activities / direct work would EA groups have a comparative advantage in?_
    *   _Research/mapping into country-specific issues? - probably better for full time researchers, but some groups may have a comparative advantage in some areas_
    *   _Policy areas - also in general better left to professional researchers but sometimes good fit in some context. NB: can be very harmful if done badly_
    *   _Incubating projects_
*   _Brainstorming exercise: How should you assess projects?_
    *   _Risks, downsides, counterfactuals, getting more information while keeping options open (reversibility)_
    *   _See how it furthers our goals + opportunity costs_
    *   _ITN framework_
*   Other / Direct work
    *   A significant portion of the problem is time. EA is becoming professional, and it's hard to compete with people working full time. You get additional returns from spending more time on research for example. (counter-argument: people present at the retreat working part-time / full-time for local groups)
    *   Harri's background in community building - he doesn't feel confident about assessing anything outside of this domain, and he doesn't have the domain expertise to have good answers to new projects
    *   Solution:** defer to experts** - has this project been endorsed by someone he sees as an expert in this area (good reasoning / epistemic processes + domain specific experience)
        *   Ask GPI, FHI, CFAR, MIRI... if you have a project proposal in mind which relates to what they do
        *   Think about who the relevant experts in the area are. Within EA? Outside (the EA community is pretty small, lots more people outside, but they are not trying to do the same thing as we are)? Contact as many as possible (but often experts are time-constrained)?
        *   Maybe first consider the aim of encouraging a project suggested by group members - make them more involved in EA or actually produce some value?
        *   Check out whether people in other places aren't doing something similar - write it down and ask for feedback on EA Forum, LessWrong, FB group...
        *   You might actually be an expert in your domain. If you are not, pretty important to work out what experts are thinking.
        *   You also need to take into account your context (e.g. country orgs should also contact "experts" in their national context, not only in the anglo-saxon world)
        *   Other benefits: feedback (sometimes people have considered your project and decided not to run it, interesting to understand their thought process), support
    *   One way of finding out whether a project is valuable: **apply for funding** (e.g. OpenPhil for big projects, EA Grants for smaller projects - they then contact the relevant experts). Caveat: they didn't give feedback on all projects last year, and sometimes didn't find relevant experts to assess the projects they received (although Kit doesn't seem to think that was that prevalent).
*   _Brainstorming exercise: Does your group have a unique comparative advantage? Who are the experts in this domain?_
*   **Unilateral action**
    *   Limited resources - contacting governments or influential people can be a one-off thing and difficult to reverse, it's important to be very cautious
    *   But inaction is also an action (journalists will write about EA without our input if we don't answer their requests for instance), and national groups could potentially have a comparative adv e.g. on media outreach - cf. Julia Wise's "[Advice for talking to journalists](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jU4snbnAIq-q4Dl_mIF0JyTT_bQrvS1wdBhQC1H-Bv8/edit?usp=sharing)"
*   **General vs specific**
    *   Difficult to know, depends on the case, but might be more useful to have people with good epistemic processes in general than very domain-specific knowledge
    *   Lack of domain-specific experts in the EA community
*   **Understanding**
    *   If in doubt about contacting experts - do! Make sure you understand how they think and what they are doing

 

 


### Session 2 - Welcoming communities (Katie)

 



*   Goal: explore how to achieve balance on welcomingness vs impact focus, and learn from each other
    *   This is hard! People feel strongly about this topic
*   Failure modes
    *   **Groups miss out on people who perceive the group unfavourably and never join** - we can see this from either side: people can see the group as not having high enough quality discussion OR as too elitist!
    *   **Groups attract great people but lose them** as they encounter things that put them off
    *   **Homogeneity**
*   How can we navigate this tension - practical focus
*   What have you tried?
    *   Holly: doesn't think they've had much success, but a few positive anecdotes. e.g. one woman, christian, SJ perspective - feeling welcome / engaged enough to run AI Safety group + Master's in AI Safety!
        *   Equality & Justice research group
        *   Newcomers - spending time thinking about what type of people you want more of (older, Black, female,...)
        *   Basic social skills training for EAs? [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.fr/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906814), Julia Wise (online resources + up for Skype calls to help out with tricky social situations)
    *   Eirin: quite a lot of women, and in high positions. Part of it is good equality norms in Norway, and also proactive effort (if choice between man and woman for interview - will send woman, lower bar for asking questions, cabin trips to include newcomers)
    *   Markus: can be daunting to take up space in EA - if running a discussion, break out in small groups to encourage people talking
    *   Konrad: one round of everyone talking but without singling anyone out. Intro seminar more culture oriented, more human, not tech/jargon oriented. Have resulted on different/older people coming. Less hardcore people, contributing differently
    *   Marcin: "[Social Justice for the Highly Demanding of Rigour](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/)" SSC. In Poland they pay attention to these characteristics, but it's also important to pay attention to other things (empower people who are more sensitive / introverted for instance). Organised a bookclub and techniques to facilitate social skills / communication. Important concepts of "average social sensitivity" and "conversational turn taking". Also: steelman people! They aim for equality of opportunities but not outcomes. Intellectual diversity matters (at the personal and at the community level).
    *   Kristina: no specific approach to this in Czech Republic. There are also costs to diversity.
    *   Remmelt: allowing people to form groups according to their interests can be powerful.
    *   Ales: quite successful at this in Harvard, 60% women. When deciding between 2 people would choose underrepresented group - not much cost. David Rock [Your Brain at Work](https://www.amazon.fr/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0061771295), [Quiet Leadership](https://www.amazon.fr/Quiet-Leadership-Steps-Transforming-Performance/dp/0060835915/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FQRPVX0JEFW3FC88N08T). He makes sure to decrease his own status so people don't feel threatened.
    *   Kit: [Unpacking Pandora's Box](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/ek/ea_diversity_unpacking_pandoras_box/), Alexander Gordon-Brown
    *   Ture: proactively look for people starting in a corner awkwardly to engage them in conversation 
    *   Katie: Berlin EAGx "ambassadors"
*   What could you try? - Pick something to experiment with
    *   **Recruitment / outreach**
            *   Joint events with different social groups (different political or religious groups for instance), although this might not work similarly in different types of local groups (e.g. student vs city / country level)
            *   1 on 1 conversations with the type of people we are missing
    *   **Events / activities**
            *   Specific events tailored to subgroups
            *   Many different events so you can target people with different interests and personalities
            *   Julia Wise - [list of activities focused on women](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Ox5If17SwhRQX1r3YjyfBCDx6F0nlk2Hk0k3ccjj6M/edit)
            *   They are less sure about _what kinds of events_, so they focused more on _how to run events_
                *   Make it nice for advanced people as well as newbies
                *   Be aware of your biases
                *   Increase the visibility of minorities
                *   Remember that it's hard
    *   **Education (= providing people with EA related info)**
            *   Recruitment process & education are overlapping at the moment
        *   Best way to initiate this is 1 on 1
        *   You have to establish a trust-based relationship - emotional rather than educational, stay likeable
        *   In order to avoid common failure mode of being seen as elitist / arrogant - educate yourself by asking lots of questions rather than educating the person; then resolving key uncertainties - you need to be familiar with the scope of already existing criticisms against EA.
        *   "Personalized Activation Ladder" - increasing people's knowledge and EA related skills as well as engagement, providing knowledge in a considerate way at varying levels of difficulty
            *   Separate existing materials in different parts with varying levels of difficulty (e.g. EA handbook in national language - LessWrong posts - TED Talks and other engaging media content, then later on you switch to more detailed / intellectually challenging publications) 
    *   **Leadership / organisation**
        *   Improving feedback culture - not too cold, too harsh or too little (warm, open & honest)
        *   Bringing in expertise from other areas (there are some things about which some people know much more than us) e.g. HR professionals
        *   Put effort into thinking about what kind of leader you are, deal with status / power constructively
        *   Making sure that the structure & organisation is clear - the more informal things are, the more biases come out
        *   Have check-ins
        *   Implement some basis of project management
*   **Communications**
    *   In-person
        *   Steel-manning (Daniel Dennett) - build the strongest case for your opponent's argument
        *   Empathy
        *   Don't disagree with people publicly
        *   Give people time to think about things
        *   Agreement gestures
    *   Online
        *   Emphasise mutual respect (we are often wrong)
        *   Outreach to adjacent communities
        *   Don't use the word "best"
        *   Give people in the outgroup a chance to become part of the ingroup
    *   Diversity is not just gender diversity


### Session 3 - Best Practices (Harri)



*   Discussion-based session
*   Funnel model - outreach (finding interesting people and getting them interested in EA) > development > action (people making concrete plans for having an impact) || organisation (how decision-making works in the group, delegation, management, etc.)
*   Brainstorming exercise: Where is your group's bottleneck?
    *   **Outreach**
        *   Not many groups are focused on this
        *   China - people are coming through the equivalent of meetup
        *   Finding expert networkers?
        *   Finding people with talent in 80K priority areas / where talent gap is identified
        *   Discourage having new people?
        *   Startup jargon "**acquisition vs retention**" - don't do so much outreach if you're not confident that you can retain people. Stick with high fidelity thinking.
    *   **Development**
        *   How to keep track of people - informal registry keeping track of what people are doing, their major bottlenecks, etc. so you can support them.
        *   "Casual but intense" 1 on 1s - how to integrate all the people floating around
    *   **Action**
        * Mid-tier positions 
        * Geography
            *   How to get people in national EA groups excited to make big changes in their lives?
            *   Integration with the greater EA Community - not as many opportunities as people interested in doing things
            *   Using volunteer time, finding things for people to do
            *   People are looking for something very concrete to do, lack of middle-ground activities
            *   Easy to include people in EA Geneva, but not willing to fly to the US for instance
            *   Network / trust issue with EA orgs who don't know people recruited at local group level
            *   No structure for helping people with their career plans - not focused on getting other people
            *   Unpaid volunteers

        * Solutions

            *   Decentralising the community from just the 2 main hubs of Oxford and Bay Area? People in the main hubs are averse to this, namely because of the risk of diluting the message, but there could be mechanisms to secure high fidelity
            *   EA organiser think tanks?
            *   High-quality decentralisation - local groups can be community-builders and incubators of projects
        *   **Organisation**
            *   Flow between bigger EA orgs and local groups
            *   Scaling up
            *   Can we trust group members well to do the tasks delegated to them
            *   More vs less formalised group structures

     


      



### Session 4 - EA Groups Vision (?), Support & Inter-group Coordination (Harri)

 



*   EA groups are likely to be instrumental to the success of the EA community (pipeline for EA talent, etc.)*
*   **Org support**
    *   **CEA / 80K**
        *   Harri is a full time local groups coordinator (main projects right now: this retreat + EA Community Building Grants). Then wants to focus on setting a higher bar for creating an EA group.
            *   Probably going to hire more "Harri"s but organisational + "getting up to speed" bottleneck (strongest constraint on CEA hiring)
            *   **Management constraints** are a big bottleneck for EA orgs
        *   80K - not providing as much coaching as we would like. Capacity-constrained and focused on headhunting for specific roles.
            *   Likely to resume at some point over the coming year but expect to do it more for non-students.
            *   **Make plans outside of 80K coaching**
            *   Should be made clearer!
        *   For most groups - organisers don't spend enough time on themselves, learning and developing EA-relevant skills + knowledge
        *   Groups don't always understand that they are not the only / main priority of CEA / Harri
    *   **LEAN / Rethink**
        *   Will continue to produce more **empirical oriented research on local groups** (local group impact assessment), and will try to build LEAN capacities around that
        *   **Resource map **- retrospectives, common threads, resource trail that will speak to local groups of whatever size / capacity (personalized trail)
        *   More **1 to 1 support**
        *   Hiring (communicative, able to distill information, able to understand that what works across groups isn't always what works for their group)
        *   SHIC - worrying about risks, their strategy align less with 80K atm (80K looking for specific people and putting them into jobs, SHIC focusing on a different part of the pipeline, and think that having a more diverse portfolio of options is prudent, esp. looking at 18 yo. They are happy to focus on a wider set of paths than 80K - less x-risk oriented, more accessible, more focused on global mental health, pvty, animal welfare...)
    *   **EAF**
        *   Based in Berlin
        *   Primary goal is to reduce S Risk
        *   A few holes they can think, incl in local group support
            *   25% of Toby's time on this, the rest is mostly on 1 to 1 outreach
        *   Fairly aligned with CEA's vision on local groups
        *   Check out his [model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4JYWuttp6CZauzH9lkry-srEIZtN2ao2T5x2bP6oXo/edit)
        *   Facilitating exchanges between groups, esp German speaking groups - 35 somewhat active groups in German-speaking world, not that many that are large and pretty active (maybe 10)
        *   Provide resources (flyers, banners, templates...)
        *   Does it make sense to do broad movement building given their specific focus?
            *   Not that much of their time going into this, and seems like they have a comparative advantage
*   **What kind of infrastructure / support would be useful?**
    *   E.g. Communication networks, guides, advice, funding, events
    *   Identify problems we have and opportunities we can see as clearly as possible. Even more useful: proposed solution
    *   "Who has the comparative advantage to do this" is a good question to ask ourselves
        *   Lots of opportunities for EA groups to help each other
    *   Why people think **existing solutions** aren't working
    *   Prioritising 
*   Discussion by type of group
    *   **Students**
        *   Material sharing
            *   Resources on discussion groups, topics
            *   Resources for reading
            *   Even though groups work quite differently - interesting to have information about groups' organisational structure
            *   Things shared in different channels --> outdated / drowned in information
        *   Intergroup communication
        *   How similar do groups have to be for communication to work
        *   80K career coaching provided within groups
            *   Centralising this?
            *   Risk of not qualified enough - but maybe still worth it?
    *   **National**
        *   Sharing best practices
            *   Metrics
            *   Fundraising
            *   Projects
            *   HR
            *   Materials
            *   Exchange of people
        *   Shared Google Drive / Slack channel for national groups
        *   Too much info and not enough response in the past - careful about info overload
        *   Scaling projects across countries
    *   **City groups (London / Geneva)**
        *   They don't want to lose track of people when they move to other places
        *   Keeping up to date with what other groups are doing
        *   More support / network - putting people in touch with experts
        *   Vouching for people
        *   Staff exchanges / going to see how other groups work
        *   Smaller group for EA group leaders
*   Metrics - CEA is probably in a good place to do this
*   Community Building Grants - Harri intends to give everyone feedback
*   EA Group coordination work - should be done independently, not by Harri


### EA across cultures

 



*   China - changed the name "effective altruism" to "rational philanthropy" (even used experts to help figure out the name change). When trying to explain basic EA concepts to chinese newbies (GW charities, cosmopolitanism...) low retention rate and didn't work well
    *   Mozi - ancient Chinese philosopher, his views are pretty aligned with EA (universal love, consequentialist, animal welfare). Start by citing him.
    *   Graham used to manage localization / internationalization - rooting out product to new countries, translating & adapting contents, but also technical issues, distribution / marketing side (e.g. Cookie policy in Europe)
*   France -
*   Norway - also thought about calling it something else than "effective altruism". "altruism" is an unusual word in Norwegian, have to explain what it means. People who have been exposed to it - mostly from biology or philosophy. The philosophical concept, includes a notion of "self-sacrifice". No good alternative, and loss of connection to international movement are big enough negatives, so decided to keep "EA". They use a lot of English (everybody speaks English in Norway), find it challenging to actually write good content. They are mainly translating things in Norwegian rather than writing content. There is a strong notion that foreign aid is a good thing, they don't need to convince people that helping others abroad is important (1% of GDP on foreign aid, agreement across parties). Media outreach - no translation, they keep this in Norwegian. Different in Oslo (open structure, several exchange students, use a lot of English) and Trondheim (only Norwegian speakers). There is also a social norm that you're not supposed to be better than anyone else. Implications: they don't focus much on individual career planning - much more focus on creating an exceptional community than exceptional individuals. Could frame it as "we're doing good together, helping each other **do **the best we can" vs "**be** the best we can"
*   London - people don't know what "altruism" is. Cheesy american materials wouldn't work in UK context. People who started EA in London 75% Oxbridge in London meetups - class or cultural gap (e.g. don't have to think about looking after your family or building up a runway). "ask" vs "guess" culture UK vs US (in the US you can just ask for what you want, whereas in the UK you have to be careful about how you frame things)
*   Poland - EA can be difficult to explain, but the name is better than alternatives that were explored at some stages. The general response amongst different demographic groups is pretty positive. Have to be cautious when talking about money / fundraising - seems self-serving. Hard to give people a clear / coherent image of EA without going deep into the philosophical underpinnings (e.g. why we are interested in very different causes). Politics can be an issue (shift towards authoritarian right wing in Poland).
*   Do we know any other orgs / movements that are cause-neutral? 
    *   Maybe Copenhagen Consensus or UN Millenium Goals?
*   Gvt / policy - how aligned do we feel our governments are?
    *   France -
    *   UK - international development (.7% of GDP to foreign aid), 5 EAs at DfID, Richard Paar (David Cameron advisor) is massively into EA (but under the radar), Sam Hilton has a group for people in policy and another for people in the civil service. Also a group with people from all political parties on AI Safety. Openness to ideas about animal welfare. Mental health - there is a department to track national happiness. Evidence based wellbeing research (What Works Wellbeing). Behavioural Insights team (nudge unit) advising government. 
    *   China - compared to many countries, the government influence is much bigger (capitalist system but with a much more centralised chain of command because of one party and massive government influence). One pro is that there is a much larger timeline - planning over decades (e.g. Xi Jinping unlimited term) - not that scary to Chinese people, feels more positive than negative and also not that big a deal (aligned to other titles that Xi Jinping already has). China poised to become the world leader on cutting emissions after US dropped out of Paris agreement. AI - gvt actively encouraging tech development and incubator, so good vibe, but the main concern for them is commercial / military applications rather than safety. If China administration understands the implications of safety (they might, because of decades long planning horizon), will have a huge impact. EA China spoke to a few prominent public intellectuals with pretty EA aligned views, but seems very hard to reach members of gvt. Government recommends a significant cut in meat consumption - but not that big of a deal, just a gvt recommendation (people still eating a lot of meat and will eat more as wealth rises). Clean meat - difficult, high sensitivity to GMO issues.
    *   Norway - essentially a ban on GMO products with a few exceptions. Farmers have a strong voice in Norway, so if they think clean meat will harm farmers, it will be difficult to get through. Meat industry shifting towards veg products (cf Germany). In Svalbad, seed valt = recovery seeds placed in a valt inside a mountain, permafrost - ground frozen throughout the year, low risk area. "Seed valt for seed valts" (have seeds from all around the world). BUT don't accept GMO seeds, and owned by Norwegian gvt - although there is an international agreement around it, with conferences, etc. EA Norway has connections to this through Eirin's mother.
    *   Poland - Marcin was a non-partisan candidate to EU parliament, but doesn't see opportunity from the actual gvt on any of the main EA causes, except maybe animal welfare, with very strong / influential animal organisation Open Cages (one recognised by ACE and with actions around EU). No strong contribution to foreign aid, but some big NGOs are quite EA-aligned. Best step is not to focus on politics but more on cultural atmosphere. SSC "Beware of Systemic Change", better not to engage in partisan politics, maybe better to focus on strong bipartisan lobbying.
    *   CEA sent some people to UK gvt to talk about far future risks. Individual outreach is more tractable. Issues of politicising EA - not using EA as a brand within policy, rather pushing specific policies.
*   **Recap**: strategy of localizing 1) gauge how important it is to do this at this moment in time (China - really important but in general probably lots of advantages of just waiting and not prioritising this) ; 2) start drafting contents yourself, without outsourcing it - even the best translators in the world don't have the deep knowledge of EA, you need to stay in charge of the message ; 3) A/B testing - not just one idea, try 2 or more different messaging strategies and test it out on people coming to local groups, so you can directly see what kinds of messaging people respond to.


## FLORENT BERTHET'S NOTES

### **Group discussions**


#### **How to optimize central orgs (CEA, etc.)**

**Comments**


*   Currently it feels weird to ask for funding because it's not clear how it works.
*   CEA is considering funding people for short periods (e.g. 6 months) to see whether they are good. If so, CEA could fund them for longer periods.
*   When deciding whether to fund applicants, CEA will put more weight on how much they trust them than on what their plans are. 
    *   There will be a minimum bar for endorsement.
    *   The more funding people ask for, the higher the bar is.
*   CEA wouldn't have to be the only org to assess funding applications, it could be done by the closest local org.
*   How much influence should  the central orgs have (e.g. a CEO-like role)?
    *   They shouldn't have the power to forbid anything or to impose guidelines on groups, but they could decide who to support and on which basis.

**Ideas**



*   Create a job marketplace with someone in charge who knows people and what is needed where.
*   Do professional development (helping groups be better groups)
    *   This may not be CEA's comparative advantage.
*   Exchange people between groups to improve learning, e.g. to visit another group for a day (CEA could fund that).


### **How should groups share resources between themselves** {#how-should-groups-share-resources-between-themselves}

**Comments**



*   Past failures in coordination may have been caused by each group being too much focused on their metrics (e.g. number of event attendees).
*   Why should groups coordinate?
*   To avoid redundancy. Groups often do some work (report, model, etc.) that is replicated by other groups.
*   To clear up controversial ideas. E.g.:
    *   The value of local groups.
    *   The value of outreach.
    *   Which model of a local group is best, if there is even one.
*   To test new things.
*   To update faster. Local groups don't update as fast as they could because of a lack of info.
*   To increase warm fuzzies through social interactions.

**Ideas**



*   Build a platform/document for groups to access and share their resources and up-to-date info. This would allow everyone to find the best resources and to know whether some work has already been done. Use cases: outreach, events such as career workshops, project management, etc.
    *   Make group participation a requirement to get funding or other resources such as books.
*   Option: have one person at the CEA be a central node of the network.
    *   Groups would send their resources on an ongoing basis to this person, who would in turn curate and update the whole thing accordingly. This would ensure the platform stays clean and easy to use.
*   Do a survey asking people if they know about relevant resources and how much they find them useful.
    *   David can create the survey, and the CEA can share it and publish the results.	
    *   Incentivize people to fill it by saying that the CEA would find it very valuable and may give them resources.
    *   Involving around 30 groups seems reasonable. This number can be updated depending on how much of a consensus there seems to be (i.e. how similar the answers are).
    *   Ask Caroline Jeanmaire whether she already has data (Florent is on it).
*   Features:
    *   This tool could guide people toward the most relevant resources by using a branching organizational system and/or by using a smart suggestion mechanism.
        *   Coordinate with LEAN (similar project).
        *   Coordinate with James ("StumbleUpon for EA" project).
    *   Allow notifications when there are important updates on something we are following (e.g. "how to make a rationality workshop?")

**Advice**



*   Ask ourselves "if there was one thing that we would like to know about the other groups, what would it be?"
*   Only share high-quality resources.
    *   By default, the signal-to-noise ratio tend to go down as the quantity of resources goes up.


### **Organizing between national groups** {#organizing-between-national-groups}

**Use cases**



    *   Joint problem solving
*   Collaborative work
    *   Organizing intergroup events (retreats, etc.)
    *   Sharing strategy + getting feedback
    *   Sharing empirical data/experience/how we updated
    *   Networking
    *   Mental health help
    *   Etc.

**Decisions**



*   For national groups only vs all local groups?
    *   All groups. [to be discussed again? Maybe open to all groups but only national groups can post?]
*   We will use a Google Group
*   Konrad is in charge setting up the group + guidelines + communication norms + moderation
*   Florent is in charge of mental health support, collaborating with Eirin

**To discuss**



*   What are the roles of national groups?
*   How to move money from funders?
*   How to do PR?
*   How to organize retreats for local groups?
*   When we want to hire someone, how to make the competition between candidates —who may be friends— not weird?
    *   Be very transparent about everything
    *   Since we want to hire the most qualified person anyway, let's just test candidates' skills and be as objective as possible (with IQ-style tests and/or work trials)


## **Lightning talks** {#lightning-talks}


### **Effective retreats (Jan)** {#effective-retreats-jan}

Think the event as some kind of story with a progression. Play with the variation of emotional intensity and with how people should engage.

Use a narrative structure people are used to:



*   A bigger trend which starts with a small peak, goes up until a high peak and then goes back down
*   Smaller trends throughout (smaller peaks)

You want a nice peak in the first day to generate engagement and interest, and a peak in the end to strengthen long term retention.

Try to make people reach a state of flow and keep them there as long as possible.

Open vs closed grouping positions: have people discuss not directly facing each other because it makes it harder for other people to join their discussion, but have them discuss in some angle (e.g. 90 degrees angle).

Activities:



*   Double cruxing
*   Shorter talks

Vary the structure over time (e.g. don't have only a succession of 1-hour talks every day). Alternate heavy long events with smaller ones and mix it up with social activities and breaks.

Use experiential learning (= learning by doing)

To measure the impact of the retreat, ask the following question before the workshop and at the end of it: "How many of these people do you know so well that you could describe them in 3 sentences?"


### **EA Concepts workshop (Huw)** {#ea-concepts-workshop-huw}

For 6-10 participants over one day (5 hours of content, around 6-7 hours total including breaks).

**Goal**



*   Improve rationality and the understanding the main arguments (far future, moral value of info, etc.)
*   Community building, especially if there are (future) community builders
*   At the end, participants should have a lot of stuff they want to know about.

**Insights**



*   How do people arrive at their own conclusions?
*   What is the diversity of thoughts among participants?
*   What rationality techniques will people include in their life?

The main goal is to make people understand the importance of taking the time to think deeply about their careers rather than giving them too specific options.

It's good to run the workshop several times to get better at it.

**Content**



    *   Fermi estimates (valuing your time, knowing how much it's worth)
    *   Cognitive reflections tests and biases
    *   Counterfactuals, marginal reasoning, bayesian reasoning.
    *   Cluster thinking as a solution to uncertainties
*   Strong and weak epistemic modesty, moral uncertainty.
*   Consciousness
*   Far future
*   AI strategy


### **Agile teams (Eirin, Jörgen)** 

**Content**

Self-organized teams and agile project management:



*   Short dev. cycles
*   Small teams
*   Customer feedback
*   Effective communication

Test things/processes and see whether we want to keep them.

Kanbans: use paper kanbans (very in-your-face)



*   Use it to update the strategy every month or so

One member of the board plays the role of a lead and one other member plays a customer.

At the end, the board should not be directing things (aim for self-organization)

People have to commit on using it (the board may have to power it through).

People were way more engaged after using this agile model because they knew everything that was important, had worked with everyone else, etc.

The board decides which projects to do, prioritizes, sets the mission and multiple goals to achieve, identifies caveats, asks people using checklists: "Do you agree on the goals? What do you want to do? Should we add anything? Etc."

They only admit people at the beginning of the semester.


### **China (Graham)**

Characteristics of China:



1.  Centralized (C.P.C.)
    1.  Power struggles inside the party
    1.  B.A.T. (Baidu Alibaba Tencent) (50%+ the revenue of all chinese unicorns)
1.  Protectionist
    1.  G.F.W. (great firewall)
    1.  S.O.E. (state-owned enterprises (100 000+))
        1.  Corruption
1.  Competitive
    1.  1 child policy (repealed one year ago), leftover women
    1.  Gaokao (college entry exams)
        1.  Migrant workers moving into big cities

How we can help:



*   Find the right messaging of EA for China
*   Exchange between top leaders and officials/CEOs in China
*   Find how to grow the movement in China


### **Double cruxing (Kit)**

A crux is a thing that if you change your mind about it, it will make you change your mind about something else. A double crux is the same thing done by two people at the same time.

There's an objective reality, but:



*   Where some people see a circle, other people see a square.
*   It's tempting to say that the other person is blind or dumb or lying.
*   If you want to have productive conversations, you want to avoid that (and avoid talking to people who do that).

Double cruxing is about trying to understand why the other person believes something different.

The usual argument goes like "A!", "not A!", "A!", "not A!"...

Instead, you could think about what could make you change your mind (there can be several things):



*   "I think B is true"
*   "If I didn't think B, I would be less confident in A!".

The other person do the same thing:



*   "I think B is false"
*   "If I thought B, I would find A more plausible!".

Steps:



*   Disagree on something
*   Each of you —this could be done alone— think about what would made you change your mind. Ideally, try to list thing that are:
    *   Likely to change your mind
    *   Easy to get data for
*   Iterate as necessary (once A is done, you can do the same for B)

This can be done unilaterally by giving to the other person the opportunity to explain why they believe the thing that could make you change your mind (B).



## RISTO UUK'S REFLECTION

Before the retreat I thought that the retreat would be most valuable to me if I came away with a more sophisticated understanding of the pros and cons of EA promotion (i.e. being able to justify the cause very well, respond to criticisms with nuance, and understand the blind spots of the philosophy and movement of effective altruism) together with very clear next steps to take with my group as well as internationally.

I had good conversations about consequentialism, utilitarianism, moral uncertainty, the difficulty of predicting consequences, and how greatness cannot be planned. I have a lot of reading to do in those areas (re-read some pieces as well as work on new material I wasn't aware of before, e.g. [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25670869-why-greatness-cannot-be-planned](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25670869-why-greatness-cannot-be-planned)). Other interesting areas for me to focus more on in this area are wicked problems, egalitarianism vs elitism, moral progress and egoism, coordination issues and incentive structures. 

In addition, I mapped out some uncertainties for myself about whether building a community is a good way to increase the proportion of resources going to doing good as well as the actual impact of those resources. I think that we need a more data-driven approach in that area rather than merely guess what's optimal. The question might be, how have effective altruism priority roles been filled in the past? 

When it comes my career, I realized that applying for effective altruism jobs is a good way to test your personal fit. Instead of reflecting and wondering, I'm going to try to apply to OpenPhil's research analyst position to find out whether I'm a good fit for that. Another test I hopefully have coming up is a data analysis internship at an energy corporation. I also want to have a larger list of options. I think I have explored more things since engaging with 80 000 Hours counterfactually, but I might still be narrowing things down too much. 

When it comes to my group, I was surprised by how many people thought that Jaan Tallinn and CFAR alumni might be great resources for EA Estonia. I currently think that CFAR scholarships might be a waste of resources and want to sit down and make a good plan to talk about this with Jaan Tallinn. Hopefully we have better options for him to improve the rationality of people who want to do good. 

My next actionable step with my group is to contact specific promising people to invite them to my core team. I am thinking of offering them internship opportunities. I think currently the biggest bottleneck is finding people who want to organize introductory events that would be good for engagement and development. I also want to have a physical place where me and others can start working full-time on EA Estonia. I might still have to do some outreach, and communities like skeptics, CFAR alumni, and technical universities are what I might look into. 

If I'm successful at building a larger core team, I can change my own priorities. I'd probably spend more time on organizing advanced events to increase the sophistication of that core team, myself, and other promising people. Huw and Darius' (EA Oxford) idea of EA concepts seems very promising and I want to try that out. I might also be able to spend more time on personal development, planning and strategy as well as having more 1:1 conversations.  

Impact assessment is an area that seems to be difficult for everybody. Hopefully we can coordinate better with each other after this retreat and share best practices for that. I want to think more about how to measure EA-alignment and how tightly-knit the team is. Another area to think more about is how we could create something that'd enable to compare groups in terms of impact to figure out what groups to try to emulate. I.e. if EA Geneva (or some other group) produced 2 people going into EA priority paths each year, we would want to do what they do so well. 

I think I got very good new ideas about how to measure people's understanding of effective altruism. For example, we could have a checklist of main EA concepts and ask people how confident they are that they could explain them to a person who is unfamiliar with these concepts. But that alone is not enough since psychology research indicates that people are usually less confident about their abilities when they actually have to explain it rather than merely think about how good they'd be at explaining (see more here: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-humility-theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-humility-theory)). So maybe another question in the feedback form should be something like this: try to explain one EA concept that you think you are most confidently able to explain. 



## RONJA'S NOTES

Note: This document is mainly for my own reflection, but other people (like attendees or people from the EA Berlin group) might find it useful as a first input on some things I learnt and changed my mind on.

I was invited to join the first (I think?) CEA Community Building retreat, featuring 30 community builders from the biggest local, national, and student EA groups in Europe (plus one from China), as well as three staff from CEA, one from LEAN, and one from EAF.


### Main Takeaways from the CEA Community Building Retreat



*   It seems important to **have a clear group goal** and to **evaluate our progress** towards that.
*   If our goal (or one of our goals) is helping members get into high-impact careers, we should **focus on careers events** (be it workshops, 1:1 meetings, or other) much more!
*   **Having personal meetings with more experienced members** (not just new ones) could be highly valuable.
*   **It's not sure how valuable project work is**, so we should put some work into thinking about the costs and benefits of continuing to do projects, and what else we could do.
*   Keep learning from other groups.
*   Ask ourselves: 
    *   What is the most important thing we could be doing right now?
    *   What is our comparative advantage? Where are our bottlenecks?


### Full Report

 

Going in, I noted down a few expectations, both on a personal and group level. Personally, I was particularly interested in talking to people about their plans and get some ideas on how I should prioritise my own career options. Regarding community building, I was curious about how other groups are generally structured, how they find and integrate promising new members, and how, if at all, they try to teach concepts and content relevant to EA. Here are some things I think I got out of this – this might be interesting if you want to know about my own experience and what I changed my mind on, but if you are instead interested in a more accurate representation of what actually happened, I recommend reading the notes taken during the sessions and asking me personally.


### Learning from other groups



*   Aha: groups work in very different ways!
*   I found it hard to make out relevant differences in environment and setup, so I'm guessing that it doesn't make sense to export whole group models, but instead try to find our own goal and weighting of priorities and use other group's strategies when they seem useful. I spent around 3hrs talking to people from NTNU (Trondheim), whose model we'd inspired our own setup by. Since two other groups have tried to also adopt that model from a blog post Jorgen wrote, and had encountered difficulties, I guess that it seems in the very least necessary to understand the motivating principles behind a model really well in order to learn how to flexibly make use of it.
*   The only difference that was relevant across the board seemed to be the one between national, local/city (non-student), and student groups, while more complex factors like cultural environment, and the city/university structure play a role which I can't break down easily.
*   What I found impressive was that most group seemed very productive at doing whatever they were optimizing for, and that these were quite different things, including events and workshops, projects, or a focus on 1:1 conversation and advice.
*   **Takeaway: whatever the goal, these groups seemed to have a clear picture of what their goal and their comparative advantage was, and had some way of measuring whether they achieved this. For EAB, it seems like a good idea to spend some time checking whether our activities are the best way of achieving our goal. I have also found it useful to keep thinking about our comparative advantage as a group. I talked to some groups about their metrics, and it seems sensible to at least experiment with a few measures we could take on events and perhaps more generally.**

 


### Projects



*   NTNU seem to be successful at running projects (ranging from events, doing research, or working on an EA-related question to then present to the group). 
*   One thing I found great is the structure they use for projects. Even if we don't do projects in the same way, it seems useful to use something like their project checklist to help our members set up their own projects, and to encourage them writing project proposals to clarify a project's goal and desired outcome.
*   Other groups (Oxford most notable among them, even though they do actually organize workshops and retreats) were more sceptical that groups based around projects were more successful than groups primarily focused on personal exchanges between members (the metric we were referring to were IASPCs - impact-adjusted significant plan changes)


### Intro seminars



*   There were a few groups (Geneva, Oxford, Trondheim, among others) who offered introductory seminars (or "EA concepts" workshops, as they are called in Oxford)
*   They seemed surprisingly similar in content, but were conducted at different levels of difficulty. EAB seems to have quite a demanding workshop seen that it is aimed at newcomers, while Oxford had a similar level but expected prior knowledge, and Geneva set the bar a bit lower, with particular emphasis on being welcoming.
*   Most groups I spoke to held workshops one evening a week for about three weeks, Geneva is experimenting with both those and more concentrated weekend-workshops.
*   Interesting ideas: compulsory reading beforehand and between sessions, but also make people read short articles while in the seminar, including ABZ planning in one session.

 


### CEA Strategy



*   We learnt about CEA's strategy and its reasoning in doing community building work. I'm not confident in accurately representing their thinking in a short text, though, so just ask me about their ideas in person!


### My own career considerations 



*   Before entering the retreat, my key uncertainties were about my personal fit for research, whether I should do an Economics master's, and how to handle trade-offs between time invested in local group work and time I could spend learning professional skills elsewhere (e.g. through part-time work or internships).
*   I became much less confident that I am a good fit for research, mostly because I realised that I might have a much higher comparative advantage in other roles. That is because I previously underestimated how useful a mixture of management and more intellectual skills could be, especially when looking at bottlenecks in current EA orgs (although these seem to be mostly in operations, and I'm still a bit unclear on what these roles entail and whether I'd enjoy them).
*    It would seem overly rash to just stop studying, but I am more keen on gaining skills and testing my fit for different roles (which makes me feel more motivated to apply to different internships and look out for things I particularly enjoy doing in the local group).

 


### Things I found particularly relevant for EA Berlin 



*   It makes sense to spend time thinking about our priorities and comparative advantage as a group, so that we choose the right projects on work on 
*   I updated on the importance of spending time on trying to figure out member's main bottlenecks and giving them 1:1 support. As a result, it seems like a good idea to trial 1:1 meetings not only for new members, but also for people who have been involved for a while. It also sounds like a good idea in general to get to know group members better!

If our main goal (or even just one of our goals) is for members to pursue highly effective careers as a result of being involved in the group, we might want to put a higher emphasis on helping people with their career plans. Currently, our plan is simply to run careers feedback sessions like the one I did a while ago, but it seems to be at least worth a thought whether there aren't better ways of achieving that aim.


### Finally, here are two wonderful things to keep in mind


    1.       What is the most important thing you could be working on at the moment?


    2.       Why are you not doing it?
