This section provides resources for an introduction to effective giving, stories of current EA donors, advice on donating, and a list of ways you can pledge a certain amount of your income. 

Even if it seems like you have relatively little to give, you may be richer than you think. Try this online calculator from Giving What We Can, to see where you fall on the world income scale and to see what you would achieve with your donation. 

For example, if an average wage earner in the UK was to donate 10% of their income, their donations could fund:

Choosing Where to Give


Finding an organisation to donate to can be challenging. Thankfully, there are some organisations that evaluate charities and recommend outstanding giving opportunities and expert fund managers that can direct your donations. Their recommended charities are characterised by evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, transparency and room for more funding.

For global health and poverty recommendations, check out GiveWell which conducts rigorous evaluations of promising interventions and charities and recommends a few highly effective charities. Their recommendations are updated every year based on new evidence. 

See recommendations by Animal Charity Evaluators to find out some of the best ways to help farmed animals. 


Looking at a broader range of cause areas, Founders Pledge conducts research and recommends charities in a variety of philanthropic fields, including climate change, pandemics, mental health and forced displacement. 

The Life You Can Save publishes a list of 22 charities working in global health and poverty based on research from GiveWell and ImpactMatters.





Open Philanthropy Project conducts research to choose where to allocate funding from Good Ventures. While they generally don’t specifically recommend charities for other donors, their  grant database and research is publically available and can be used to inform giving. Each year Open Philanthropy Projects’ staff publish their suggestions for individual donors (suggestions from December 2018). 

Another option is to give your money to a philanthropic fund managed by experts. 

EA Funds has funds for Global Health and Development, Animal Welfare, Long-Term Future, and Effective Altruism Meta.

The EA Foundation has a fund dedicated to supporting research and policy efforts to prevent technological risks facing our civilization. 



Finally, you could put your money into a Donor Lottery where one donor is selected to choose how all the funds are donated. For example if you donated $10,000 into a fund that generated $100,000, you would have a 10% chance of being able to choose where $100,000 from that fund gets donated. 

This has an advantage over simply donating if you believe a donation of $100,000 to the organisation you wish to support is more than 10 times better than donating $10,000 to them. Also the person that wins the lottery will be more likely to be motivated to do in-depth research to work out where to donate the money, and that might result in better choices than if all the contributing donors did only a little research to choose where to donate their smaller sums. The Centre for Effective Altruism organises a donor lottery once a year.


Advice on donating efficiently

Tax information
Table of EA-recommended charities and tax-deductible status by country. This table also includes a tax-efficient way of donating to each charity from each country. Remember that charities vary a huge amount in how cost-effective they are. If you get a 30% tax credit for donating, it is better to donate to a charity you think is best, rather than donating 30% more to a tax deductible charity, if you believe your best charity is more than 30% better than the tax-deductible charity.  
If your chosen charity isn’t tax deductible in your country you can apply to swap your donations with an international donor.

Reasons not to donate now
If you’re early in your career, you may want to consider earning to save rather than donating immediately.
Paul Christiano discusses the reasons for and against giving now and giving later.
Economist Eva Vivalt discusses why she now favours giving later. 
If you want to allocate your donations later, but still want the money to come out of your bank account now, you can create a Donor Advised Fund. This will allow you to get psychological and tax benefits that go along with donating now, and you can choose later where the money goes. Donor Advised Funds can only grant to registered charities in your country, so the use of your money is restricted.
