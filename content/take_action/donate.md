This section provides resources for an introduction to effective giving, stories of current EA donors, advice on donating, and a list of ways you can pledge a certain amount of your income. 

Even if it seems like you have relatively little to give, you may be richer than you think. Try this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">online calculator</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>, to see where you fall on the world income scale and to see what you would achieve with your donation. 

For example, if an average wage earner in the UK was to donate 10% of their income, their donations could fund:

# Choosing Where to Give

Finding an organisation to donate to can be challenging. Thankfully, there are some organisations that evaluate charities and recommend outstanding giving opportunities, and expert fund managers that can direct your donations. Their recommended charities are characterised by evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, transparency and room for more funding.

## Charity Evaluators

## Donor Lotteries

You could also choose to put your money into a Donor Lottery where one donor is selected to choose how all the funds are donated. For example if you donated $10,000 into a fund that generated $100,000, you would have a 10% chance of being able to choose where the entire $100,000 gets donated. 

This has an advantage over simply donating if you believe a donation of $100,000 to the organisation you wish to support is more than 10 times better than donating $10,000 to them. Also the person that wins the lottery will be more likely to be motivated to do in-depth research to work out where to donate the money, and that might result in a better choice than if all the contributing donors did only a little research to choose where to donate their smaller sums. The Centre for Effective Altruism <a target="_blank" href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/lotteries">organises a donor lottery once a year</a>.

# Advice on donating efficiently

## Giving Tuesday

* Donors wishing to donate to US registered charities may wish to utilise Facebook's donation matching campaign "Giving Tuesday". Each year on a Tuesday in late November or early December Facebook will match donations made through Facebook to registered charities until their matching funds are exhausted. The funds usually run out in seconds, and while some other countries are eligible, few donors from outside of US manages to get their donations matched. More information is on the EA Giving Tuesday <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eagivingtuesday.org/">website</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/eagivingtuesday/">facebook group</a>. 


## Tax information

* <a target="_blank" href="https://donationswap.eahub.org/charities/">Table of EA-recommended charities and tax-deductible status by country</a>. This table also includes a tax-efficient way of donating to each charity from each country. Remember that charities vary a huge amount in how cost-effective they are. If you get a 30% tax credit for donating, it is better to donate to a charity you think is best, rather than donating 30% more to a tax deductible charity, if you believe the best charity is more than 30% more cost-effective than the tax-deductible charity.  
* If your chosen charity isn’t tax deductible in your country you can apply to <a target="_blank" href="http://donationswap.eahub.org">swap your donations with an international donor</a>. 
  If you are in a country with a large number of tax-deductible EA charities (e.g. UK, US, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland), you may wish to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://donationswap.eahub.org">donation swap system</a> to help other donors get tax deductions.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tNfDWLzBMi9HnoTkE/uk-income-tax-and-donations">Understanding tax for UK donors</a>. 
* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-101#be-aware-of-how-taxes-work">Guide to tax for US donors</a>. 
  Note: the standard deduction has increased since this article was written. Find the current standard deduction <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/how-much-is-my-standard-deduction">here</a>.  

## Reasons not to donate now

* If you’re early in your career, you may want to consider <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3ijnLaws7mCEogD6H/earning-to-save-give-1-save-10">earning to save</a> rather than donating immediately.
* Paul Christiano discusses the reasons for and against <a target="_blank" href="https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/03/12/giving-now-vs-later/">giving now and giving later</a>.
* Economist Eva Vivalt discusses why <a target="_blank" href="https://evavivalt.com/2019/07/give-later">she now favours giving later</a>. 
* If you want to allocate your donations later, but still want the money to come out of your bank account now, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/2013/06/how-to-create-a-donor-advised-fund/">create a Donor Advised Fund</a>. This will allow you to get psychological and tax benefits that go along with donating now, and you can choose later where the money goes. Donor Advised Funds can only grant to registered charities in your country, so the use of your money is restricted.

## Whether to split your donations between several charities or just donate to one

* Advice from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.benkuhn.net/how-many-causes">Ben Kuhn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://reg-charity.org/to-split-or-not-to-split-part-1/">Raising for Effective Giving</a>.

## Matching Campaigns

* Some charities offer to double or triple your donations - called "donation matching. While there are some exceptions, this matching is usually illusory and the matching funds would have gone to the charity whether or not you donated. This <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/">blog post by GiveWell</a> explains more. Exceptions include Facebook's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eagivingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a>, as while Facebook would have donated the money without your donation, your donation could cause the money to be allocated to more effective charities.
