The most common EA events are <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/events/discussions/">Discussion Groups</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/events/social/">Socials</a>, but there are a wide variety of events you could run.   

See the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B96vudaQY1XJ1c2RCKXqnOuL8Sal0PQUpav5NnbOCb4/edit#gid=0">EA Event Types Spreadsheet</a> for a list of event types containing information on event characteristics, preparation, ideal audiences, group types and required skills and resources. The spreadsheet also links to further resources on most event types. This list is a work in progress so please feel free to add comments. 

Try to mix things up and learn what works well for your group. Different people are attracted to different activities so having a variety of events can result in a wider range of people getting involved.
