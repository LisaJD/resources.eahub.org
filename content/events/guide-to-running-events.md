This is a section. It's a guide to running events.  

Because it's a section, it appears in the menu (under its category, "Events").  

It refers to some more detailed articles:

* [Planning checklist](/events/articles/planning-checklist)
* [On the day checklist](/events/articles/on-the-day-checklist)

Sections can contain images.
