LEAN provides email forwarders and email addresses to EA groups around the world. All groups are automatically provided with an email forwarder. A forwarder is not a full email account. What it does is to redirect any emails sent to it onto the personal email address of the group organiser. However, if the organiser replies to an email that came by forwarder, their reply would appear to come from their personal email address, rather than from the group address.

To use the LEAN email address as a fully functioning email address, you need to configure your personal webmail account in order to import mail from our webhost. This guide will show you how to configure a gmail account. The steps should be similar with other webmail clients such as Yahoo or Hotmail. If you run into trouble, though, you can always ask for help by emailing <mailto:lean@eahub.org>

1: From your Gmail inbox, go to “Settings” by clicking on the cog icon on the top right:

2: Select “Account and Import”

3: Next to “Send Mail As” select “add another email address”

4: In the box that pops up, add the name that you want people in your group to know you by, and the group email address that we have given you. For instance, if you are organising EA North Pole, you might put your own name here (e.g. “Jack”) or you might choose to put the group’s name (“EA North Pole”), but the email field will have the email we gave you (e.g. “<mailto:northpole@eahub.org>”). In this example I am setting up a gmail account to connect with my LEAN Manager email account (<mailto:richenda@eahub.org>), and I am using my own name.

5: In the final step you must use the email password that LEAN sent you, and you must adjust the SMTP port so that it matches the following specification:

By default, at this stage, Gmail will give you a box with these settings:

However, you need to change the port to match the specification shown above.

Once you have done that, this window will look like this:

At this point you can select “Add Account”

6: Finally, a verification email will be forwarded by us to your personal email account. Once you receive this email, either click on the link it contains, or type the code into the verification window:

Your settings will now display the new email address in the ‘Accounts and Import’ area:

Congratulations!
