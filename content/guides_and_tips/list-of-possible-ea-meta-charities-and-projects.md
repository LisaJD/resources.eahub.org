<p></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>There are many possible projects and organisations that could enable others to do more good. Only a few of them exist in reality at the moment. It’s easy to think that some ideas are bad just because current organisations haven’t implemented them. But it could be that many good ideas are not implemented simply due to a lack of capacity, or because the right person hasn't heard the right idea. That said, we should also be aware of <u><a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/unilateralists-curse/">the unilateralist curse </a></u>and be careful not to implement ideas that many people think could be harmful.</p><p>To help people decide which EA meta-charities to found, we created a list of all the possible options we could think of. The list is a result of 5 people (David Nash, Jamie Harris, Nuzhat Jabinh, Samuel Hilton, and Saulius Šimčikas) brainstorming for a couple of hours in an event organised by Samuel Hilton. We later found out that <u><a href="https://www.notion.so/EA-Summit-Project-Ideas-62dafc9a24034cd18d979caab3654168">a similar list</a></u> was created during EA Summit. I merged the ideas for meta-charities from the EA Summit’s list to our list below. Note that the EA Summit’s list also contains ideas for research and non-meta-charities that were not merged into the list below. You can see our list without the ideas from EA Summit <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F067A7YOOzxBlOG-QC4C6YL2o4sCfbIwV0hjU7OVpnY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></u>.</p><p>Similar lists of ideas for EA charities and projects include:</p><ul><li>GiveWell’s blog post <u><a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/">Charities we’d like to see</a></u></li><li>Animal Charity Evaluators blogs:</li><ul><li><u><a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/charities-wed-like-to-see/">Charities we’d like to see</a></u></li><li><u><a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/interventions-wed-like-to-see/">Interventions we'd like to see</a></u></li><li><u><a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/charities-were-excited-about/">Charities we’re excited about</a></u> </li></ul><li>William MacAskill’s <u><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ucEgGZDYpenXLDCWR/projects-i-d-like-to-see">Projects I'd like to see</a></u></li><li>EA Summit’s <u><a href="https://www.notion.so/EA-Summit-Project-Ideas-62dafc9a24034cd18d979caab3654168">aforementioned list</a></u></li></ul><p>Please comment about other ideas for meta-charities and projects that you have, and tell which ideas you are most excited about.</p><p>  </p><h2>Careers</h2><p>80,000 Hours is the only EA organisation (that I know of) that is focusing on careers. However, they are a small team and they are not doing everything that could be done in this vast space.</p><ul><li>An organisation solely focused on running career workshops</li><li>One-on-one career consulting</li><li>Provide recruitment support for high-impact projects  <br><em>"One constant bottleneck for high-impact projects is recruiting excellent people. Plus, each high-impact project must discover on its own how to source promising candidates for jobs resulting in duplication of effort. A project that discovered the tools of the best recruiters and helped high-impact projects recruit talented people might be especially valuable." (by Kerry Vaughan)</em></li><li>Research on what careers to go into:</li><ul><li>Best careers if you are not focused on the far future</li><li>Best careers for those who are finishing a PhD</li><li>How to decide what to study</li><li>Career decisions for people part way through careers – <br><em>For example, comparing switching costs and benefits like loss of career capital, leveraging your existing skills, etc.</em></li></ul><li>Research on how to do good once you are working in:</li><ul><li>Policy<br><em><a href="https://hipe.org.uk/">HIPE</a> does it in UK but it could be done in other countries</em></li><li>Politics</li><li>Finance</li><li>Academia</li><li>Military</li><li>Etc</li></ul><li><u><a href="http://effectivethesis.com/">Effective thesis</a></u>, but higher up the academic chain</li><li>Convince college career counsellors to distribute 80,000 Hours materials to interested students<em> (by EA Summit Team)</em></li><li>An org that specialises in helping people with careers in one cause area (e.g. global health/poverty)</li><li>A cause prioritisation research camp (similar to <u><a href="https://aisafetycamp.com/">AI safety camp</a></u>)</li><li>Recruit and train AI-safety researchers<br><em>"One bottleneck on the work done by AI-safety groups like</em><a href="https://intelligence.org/"> <em><u>MIRI</u></em></a><em> is the difficulty of finding mathematicians and computer scientists suited to the task. Projects that increased the number of researchers available for this work would therefore amplify the work done across the entire field.” (by Kerry Vaughan)</em></li><ul><li>Run an existential risk workshop<br><em>For example, MIRIx workshops. (by Evan Gaensbauer)</em></li><li>Create AI Safety course (or other EA education course) study groups<br><em>"An EA group leader/organize, either with a local group or online, could lead a study group for, for example, the 'Road to AI Safety Excellence' online course put out by EA Nederlands:</em><a href="http://aisafety.camp/study-group/"> <em><u>http://aisafety.camp/study-group/</u></em></a><em>." (by Evan Gaensbauer)</em></li></ul></ul><h2>Helping charities/organisations</h2><ul><li>Services for charities</li><ul><li>(Free) service that helps make charities more transparent<br><em>e.g. software that makes it easy for charities to show all the incoming donations, spending, financial information etc. Some inspiration can be taken from <u><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">AMF</a></u> website. This would make it easier for people to trust and evaluate charities.</em></li><li>Charity auditor that assess effectiveness as part of the process</li><li>System for ‘industry self-regulation’ of the charity sector</li></ul><li>EA organisation auditor<br><em>An independent organisation that provides an audit service to EA orgs to offer an external evaluation on how effective they are and other things. Alternatively, EA self-regulator.</em></li><li>Charity incubator<br><em><u><a href="http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/">Charity Entrepreneurship</a></u> is great but they only tackle one cause area every year. If we want many new organisations to be created in many cause areas (e.g. meta, far future, mental health, climate change, biosecurity, nuclear security, etc.), we may want to have another similar organisation. </em></li><li>EA odd job team</li><li>Diversity: like <u><a href="http://encompassmovement.org/">Encompass</a></u> but for EA<br><em>Encompass promotes diversity among animal rights organisations, could have something similar in EA.</em></li><li>Consulting to:</li><ul><li>Foundations<br><em>"While most donations come from individuals, the largest concentration of donations comes from large foundations. An organization that provides advisory services to foundations, especially to foundations that are being created might be especially high impact."  (by Kerry Vaughan)</em></li><li>Companies<br><em>to improve their corporate social responsibility programmes or volunteering</em></li><li>Charities and other organisations that want to do good directly</li><ul><li>How to become more transparent</li><li>How to self-evaluate effectiveness</li><li>How to demonstrate the effectiveness and raise funds from the EA community</li></ul></ul><li>Create an EA projects advice group<br><em>"Create a Facebook group or google email list where people do brief writeups of new EA projects they plan to work on and/or EA related life or career plans and others give feedback on how those project plans could be improved" (by Spencer Greenberg)</em></li><li>A vetting system for project ideas<br><em>A system where someone could submit an idea out there and EAs (eventually including those who are very involved in EA) add their thoughts and considerations. It would help to avoid the unilateralist curse and could help promising projects with funding by showing potential funders that well-known EAs are excited about the project. Facebook pages have the capacity for brainstorming and discussion, but may be inefficient, and may not always have the people we most want weighing in on the discussions (by Catherine Low).</em></li></ul><h2>Coordination</h2><ul><li>Coordination for EA researchers<br><em>Many organisations want many things to be researched and many people would like to try out EA research to see if that’s a career option for them. What is more, it's difficult to know who is working on what at any given time, which makes it likely for two researchers to work on the same topic without knowing about each other. I wrote about problems and possible solutions in more detail <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-43VqNLiLBRVpifXjjR8tnD2iScWZ1kF6Sr4a5z7_E/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></u>.</em></li><li>Volunteer coordination</li><ul><li>Pro bono time coordination</li><li>Resource provision</li><li>Mentoring</li></ul><li>EA orgs coordinator</li><ul><li>Like <u><a href="https://www.iod.com/about">Institute of Directors</a></u> but for EA<br><em>offering support and resource sharing and training and ensuring EA views are taken into account when the government is reviewing policy or seeking opinions.</em></li></ul><li><u><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/io6yLz6GtF6kvXt99/ideas-for-improving-funding-for-individual-eas-ea-projects">Improving Funding for Individual EAs, EA Projects, and New EA Organizations</a></u> (click the link to see ideas about how to do it)</li><li>Funding redistributors within specific fields<br><em>Like EA grants or EA funds but more specifi</em>c</li><li>More post-impact funding provision (e.g. <em><u><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/ak/certificates_of_impact/">certificates of impact</a></u>)</em></li><li>EA expertise board<br><em>e.g. if you would need to speak to a climate change expert who is also an EA, you could find it there</em></li><li>Coordination of specific fields where networking is useful<br><em>Currently, it’s done on Facebook but it’s not optimal</em></li></ul><h2 id="Software_platforms">Software platforms</h2><ul><li>Build a platform to match projects with people who can do them <br>(by <em>Florent Berthet as part of Tech Initiatives)</em></li><li>Build<a href="http://untapt.com/"> <u>untapt.com</u></a> (connects qualified applicants to companies building great teams and great products) for nonprofits<br><em>(by Michal Trzesimiech as part of Tech Initiatives)</em></li><li>Make an X-risks mapping platform <br><em>"To list the current existential risk organisations (and their needs), probability estimates for each risk, papers and discussions" (by Florent Berthet as part of Tech Initiatives)</em></li><li>Build a platform or service to match EA mentors and mentees for coaching/advice via video calls<br><em>"Focus on mental health / productivity for people already familiar with EA and provide career / donation advice for newcomers.
