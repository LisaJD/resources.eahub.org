The [Centre for Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org) aims to fund projects and activities which further the aim to ‘create a global community of people who have made helping others a core part of their lives, and who use evidence and scientific reasoning to figure out how to do so as effectively as possible’.

There are three different kinds of available funding, which CEA strongly encourages groups to apply for: project grants, general grants and reimbursements. There are also mentorship opportunities available. If you are uncertain whether your group would be likely to receive funding, or any other aspects of the application process, feel free to get in touch with CEA at [groups@effectivealtruism.org](mailto:groups@effectivealtruism.org).

## EA Group Project Grants

Project grants of $200 or more are given to a group to help it to run specific activities, events or projects. Examples include fellowships, discussion groups, speaker events series and reading groups.

In order to apply, organisers submit a project proposal, including a description of the project’s aims and projected budget. Successful applicants will write a review of their project upon completion, which will be made public to other EA Group organisers. Project proposals and reviews should be no longer than 2 pages each.

The aim of this process is to encourage groups to adopt a goal-oriented approach to their group’s activities, and to enable them to more easily learn from and adapt the best practices of other EA groups.

Organisers are welcome to discuss their project proposals with CEA before applying. They will receive feedback on their project proposal after applying, and can also be connected with one-to-one mentoring for their project where available. For this reason we also encourage project organisers to submit a project proposal even if they have no projected costs.

There is no strict limit on the funding that a group can apply for, although applications for amounts above $2,500 may be better suited to [EA Grants](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/grants/). Project organisers who are currently independent of an EA group are also able to apply for funding. There are no strong restrictions on the kinds of activities or projects that can receive funding, so long as they are directed at achieving the above aim.

## EA Group General Grants

In addition to project-based funding, EA Groups will be able to apply for funding for other general expenditures which aren’t related to any particular project, including EA-related books, venue rental, student activities fairs, web hosting, social events etc. To apply for general funding, groups should give a summary of their projected expenditure (excluding project-based funding) for the coming term or semester. The funding available to groups would typically not exceed $500 per semester. Unlike for project grants, groups which receive general grants won’t be required to write a subsequent review. Groups are able to receive both general and project grants simultaneously.

## Reimbursements

We encourage groups to apply for grant funding in advance of expenditure, although we can also provide reimbursements for past purchases on a case by case basis.

## CEA’s Mission and Aims

CEA will only legally be able to fund projects and activities which further its mission and aims, which can be found [here](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1149828&subid=0).

## Mentorship

Mentorship is available from CEA’s Local Groups Coordinator, EA Group Support Volunteers, and external mentors including staff at other EA organisations and members of the EA community. It includes both one-off guidance and ongoing advice, for either a specific project or running a group in general. To express interested in receiving mentorship, please note this when filling out the funding application form. You can do this even if you don’t require financial support for your group or project.
