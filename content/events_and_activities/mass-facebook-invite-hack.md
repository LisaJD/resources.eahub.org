Making Facebook invites easy

Facebook is by far the largest driver of attendance for our events, so it’s really important to invite as many people as possible. Done right, this need only take a few seconds per event.



Step 1: choose who you want to invite

There’s no point inviting people outside of Cambridge to a Cambridge-only event. Facebook does try and work out who is in Cambridge and not, but this is very inaccurate: it only detects 50% of my friends correctly. 



Instead, we’ll create a list of all the people who you want to invite to events. This takes a little bit of time up front, but you only need to do it once.



Go here (or click “more” in the friends tab on the left hand side of Facebook) and click “Create list”:



You’ll see a dialogue pop up. Give it any name you want. Leave the members blank: we’ll add them in the next step.





Now, you should see a blank list:



Click on “Manage list” and then “Edit list”:



Select “friends” from the drop-down menu in the top left corner. Go through your list of friends, clicking on anyone at Cambridge. When done, click “Finish”.

Step  3: 

You’re now set up to invite all your friends who care about our events in just a few seconds. On any event, go to Invite->Choose Friends like usual:



From the left, select the list you just created. You may have to click “More…” underneath “Suggested” to see this:









Now, just hit “Select All” and “Send invitations” and you’re done!



Step 3: update your list with recently added friends

As you make new friends, don’t forget to add them to the list! I tend to go through once a month all my recently added friends (instructions to see your recently added friends here), and add them to the list.



Hope this helps and saves you some time! Let me know if anything doesn’t work or if you have any questions (email adgleave@gmail.com.)
