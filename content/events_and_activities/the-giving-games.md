  use with groups on www.shicschools.org. To learn by yourself, continue this

Thanks to our partnership with The Life You Can Save, you begin a Giving Game by receiving $5 in real money. Yes, real real money. You will then get presented with a series of charities.

After some brief explanation, you can deliberate and ultimately choose to donate the money to one of these charities, the one that you deem most worthy. Through this, we want to get you to consider how to tackle some of the most pressing problems of our time in the most effective way.
