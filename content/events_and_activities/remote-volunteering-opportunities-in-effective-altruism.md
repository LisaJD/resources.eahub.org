Introduction



There is a lot of discussion in effective altruism about how to use one's career to do good, either through earning to give as a donor to effective charities or organizations, or with your time through direct work at one of those organizations. In geographic hubs like Oxford or Berkeley there are opportunities to volunteer at an effective altruism organization in person. However, worldwide, there are now thousands of effective altruists, and their spare time is an under-utilized resource by organizations in the effective altruism ecosystem. 80,000 Hours rightly point out using your spare time to upgrade your education or learn transferable skills to further your career. However, effective altruism is a community attractive to people from all walks of life. This leaves EA with a lot of community members whose time for a variety of reasons goes unused:



\    Students seeking to build their skills through volunteering, or want to volunteer as an effective non-profit as an extra-curricular activity.

\    Individuals at later stages of specialization in their careers, when acquiring new skills is less valuable at the margin than leveraging the valuable skills they already have with high-impact volunteering opportunities.

\    Unskilled individuals who for whatever reason don't have the opportunities for higher education or skills-building to lead a high-impact career available to them, but are nonetheless eager to volunteer their time for a high-impact cause.

\    Homemakers, stay-at home parents, retirees and other supporters of effective altruism who have time to spare but aren't seeking to (re-)enter the workplace for the foreseeable future.



There are also several organizations part of the effective altruism or allied movements focused on causes common to EA which primarily focus on research, outreach and advocacy, Often these organizations depend on volunteers to keep costs low, spread awareness, raise funds, and run their projects. The EA community actively grows through word of mouth and on the internet to a degree many organizations may not notice, and there is consistent demand for volunteer opportunities. They're out there, but they're not written down all in one place. I've surveyed organizations in and around EA for volunteer opportunities, and I've compiled them below. For the purposes of this master list, "volunteering" is broadly defined as a designated activity or task an effective altruist can take up in their spare time.

How to Read This List

For Aspiring Volunteers



On this list are volunteer opportunities in the following focus areas across 16 different projects and organizations:



\    Global Poverty Alleviation

\    Farm Animal Welfare

\    Wild Animal Welfare

\    AI Safety & Existential Risk

\    EA Community (Movement-Building, Education & Outreach)

\    Anti-Ageing



For students and other EA community members at the beginning of their careers, all these organizations provide the opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience and contacts with EA organizations and at non-profits working on high-impact causes. For volunteers without much non-profit experience or who are looking to build their skills, several of these organizations provide the opportunity to learn and develop skills which are not only invaluable in volunteering but can be transferred to professional work on any cause. In descending order of availability, these skills include:



\    Writing, Editing, Proof-reading and Translation

\    Social Media Engagement/Management

\    Public Speaking & Presentation

\    Event Planning & Organization

\    Fundraising

\    In-Person and Online Advocacy & Activism

\    Information Searches & Research Assistance

\    Project Management



Several of the organizations on this list are seeking volunteers with prior experience or expertise with the following skill sets. These include:

Feel free to search this list using these terms, or to browse the list until you find a volunteer opportunity fitting your skills and interests.

For Meetup/Community Organizers



One idea for a meetup is to have an EA volunteer opportunity presentation & sign-up party. Another volunteer opportunity as a meetup organizer is to run events for effective altruists or other groups to raise awareness of effective altruism and related causes. The last section of this list is 'Volunteer to Organize A Local Event', including lists resources for EA meetups, and non-profits supporting the independent organization of advocacy, outreach, and fundraising events.

For Organizations



If you know of a volunteer opportunity for effective altruists not on this list, please let me know so I may add it. Please provide the name of your organization or project, the area you're focused on, the skills or requirements for the volunteer role you're seeking to fill, contact info, and if possible a webpage where prospective volunteers to learn more about the opportunity.

\    MIRI wants to support AI safety research around the world. Our MIRIx program encourages mathematicians, computer scientists, and formal philosophers to organize their own workshops, and offers to reimburse the organizers for expenses.A MIRIx workshop can be as simple as gathering some of your friends to read MIRI papers together, talk about them, eat some snacks, scribble some ideas on whiteboards, and go out to dinner together. Or it can be a multi-day research workshop pursuing a specific line of attack on a particular problem. It’s up to you.In some cases we’ll be able to send a MIRI research fellow to your first meeting to give tutorials and answer questions, or perhaps they’ll Skype in to your workshop to do the same. We’ll work out the details, and send you some tips on how to organize the workshop.



 You can inquire with MIRI about starting a local MIRIx workshop using this online form, or check out if there is a workshop active in your city at the MIRIx webpage.
