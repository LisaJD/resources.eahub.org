The EA Hub is a platform designed to inspire and facilitate collaboration between Effective Altruists. Whether you want to launch a project, run a group, network with other EAs or explore EA Survey data, the Hub is your port of call.

The Hub was founded by Tom Ash in 2014, and managed by .impact. <a href="https://rtcharity.org/">Rethink Charity</a> continues to manage the site, and a great number of volunteers - past and present - have lent their time and expertise.
