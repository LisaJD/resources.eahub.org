# Connect With Other Organisers

The EA Group Organizers Facebook group is a great place to ask questions. There is also an EA Groups Slack workspace, where you can share resources and ask questions. To join the Slack workspace, click here.

Here are some ways to find other groups to ask if they’d be willing to give you a hand:

* Search on the EA Hub
* Search for “[nearby city or university] Effective Altruism” on Facebook

If you are running a uni group, it’s also a good idea to talk to some organisers of other clubs at your university. They might be able to give you a sense of how to navigate policies, publicise events, and tailor general club-running advice to your university in particular.
