In order to do the most good we can, the EA community will ideally be a happy, healthy community that fosters a stimulating atmosphere to encourage people to be ambitious and inspired creates a supportive community, in which we help each other with personal struggles, 
and that people enjoy being a part of. 

_“Collaborative Spirit”_ is one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles">guiding principles of effective altruism</a>:

> “We affirm a commitment to building a friendly, open, and welcoming environment in which many different approaches can flourish, and in which a wide range of perspectives can be evaluated on their merits. In order to encourage cooperation and collaboration between people with widely varying circumstances and ways of thinking, we resolve to treat people of different worldviews, values, backgrounds, and identities kindly and respectfully”.

These pages provide tips to help your group fulfil this principle of “Collaborative Spirit”.
